## Bank of Japan

On October 31, 2024, the Bank of Japan (BoJ) held a Monetary Policy Meeting where it unanimously decided to maintain the guideline for money market operations, encouraging the uncollateralized overnight call rate to remain around 0.25 percent.

In its Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices, the BoJ outlined several key points:

1. **Economic Growth**: Japan's economy is expected to grow above its potential growth rate, driven by moderate overseas growth and a positive cycle of income boosting spending, supported by accommodative financial conditions.

2. **Inflation Projections**: The consumer price index (CPI), excluding fresh food, is projected to rise by approximately 2.5% for fiscal 2024, tapering to around 2% for fiscal 2025 and 2026. This reflects a gradual increase in underlying inflation due to an improving output gap and rising inflation expectations.

3. **Consumer Prices**: The impact of previous import price increases on consumer prices is expected to lessen, while government measures to mitigate inflationary pressures are anticipated to support CPI growth in the coming years.

4. **Risks to the Outlook**: The BoJ recognizes significant uncertainties regarding economic activity and prices, particularly related to overseas economic developments, commodity prices, and domestic wage and price-setting behaviors. The risks to economic activity are viewed as balanced, while price risks are tilted to the upside for fiscal 2025.

5. **Current Economic Conditions**: Japan's economy is showing moderate recovery, with improvements in corporate profits and business sentiment. Private consumption is gradually increasing, despite some challenges from rising prices. Employment and income conditions are also improving, supporting consumer spending.

6. **Monetary Policy Outlook**: The BoJ intends to adjust its monetary policy in response to economic developments, focusing on balancing growth support with achieving its 2% price stability target. The bank will closely monitor financial and foreign exchange market developments, which could significantly influence Japan's economic activity and inflation.

Overall, the BoJ's outlook reflects cautious optimism regarding Japan's economic prospects, emphasizing the importance of managing inflation while fostering sustainable growth amid various uncertainties.
