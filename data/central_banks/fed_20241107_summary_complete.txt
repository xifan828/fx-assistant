## Federal Open Market Committee US

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) recently announced a reduction in the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, bringing it to 4.5% - 4.75%. This decision reflects ongoing economic expansion, although labor market conditions have eased slightly, with a modest increase in the unemployment rate, which remains low. Inflation is progressing towards the Committee's 2% target but is still somewhat elevated.

The FOMC acknowledges the uncertain economic outlook and believes that risks to achieving its dual mandate of maximum employment and stable inflation are balanced. The Committee is committed to monitoring incoming data and may adjust monetary policy as necessary to support its goals. 

Recent financial market developments indicate rising Treasury yields and increased equity prices, driven by solid economic indicators. The economic situation shows robust GDP growth, though job gains have moderated, and inflation is slightly above the target at 2.1% for total PCE and 2.7% for core inflation.

Internationally, easing inflation in other advanced economies has contributed to a stronger U.S. dollar. The FOMC remains vigilant regarding potential volatility in economic data and global growth concerns.

The next FOMC meeting is scheduled for December 17-18, 2024, where further assessments of the economic landscape will be made.
