## European Central Bank

On September 12, 2024, the European Central Bank (ECB) announced a reduction in the deposit facility rate by 25 basis points, bringing it down to 3.50%. This decision was made unanimously by the Governing Council and reflects a moderation in the monetary policy stance in response to the current inflation dynamics and economic conditions.

### Key Highlights:

- **Inflation Projections**: The ECB projects headline inflation to average 2.5% in 2024, 2.2% in 2025, and 1.9% in 2026. Core inflation estimates have been slightly revised upwards due to stronger-than-expected services inflation. A rise in inflation is anticipated in late 2024 due to base effects from energy prices, but it is expected to decline towards the 2% target by the end of 2025.

- **Economic Growth**: The euro area economy grew by 0.2% in Q2 2024, primarily driven by net exports and government spending, while private consumption and investment showed weakness. The growth forecast has been slightly downgraded to 0.8% for 2024, with projections of 1.3% in 2025 and 1.5% in 2026.

- **Monetary Policy Approach**: The ECB will continue to adopt a data-dependent approach for future interest rate decisions, ensuring that policy rates remain sufficiently restrictive until inflation aligns with the target. The Governing Council is not committing to a specific rate path, allowing for flexibility based on incoming economic data.

- **Risks and Challenges**: The ECB acknowledges downside risks to economic growth stemming from global conditions and geopolitical tensions, while upside risks to inflation may arise from wage increases and energy price fluctuations.

- **Financial Conditions**: Although market interest rates have decreased, financing conditions remain tight, with sluggish credit growth amid weak demand. The ECB is closely monitoring the effects of previous monetary policy decisions on the economy.

In conclusion, the ECB is focused on achieving its inflation target while navigating a complex economic environment, with future decisions being made on a meeting-by-meeting basis.
