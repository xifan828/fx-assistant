## Federal Open Market Committee US

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) recently convened and decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4.25% - 4.50%. This decision reflects ongoing economic expansion, with solid GDP growth and a low unemployment rate of 4.2%. However, inflation remains above the Committee's 2% target, currently at 2.3%, indicating that while progress has been made, challenges persist.

The FOMC noted that labor market conditions have eased, and the risks to achieving maximum employment and price stability are viewed as balanced. Participants expressed concerns about persistent inflation, despite signs of disinflation. The Committee emphasized the importance of monitoring incoming data and the evolving economic outlook to inform future policy adjustments.

In addition to adjusting the federal funds rate, the FOMC will continue to reduce its holdings of Treasury and agency securities. The economic outlook remains uncertain, with projections indicating GDP growth may slow slightly, but inflation is expected to stabilize around 2% by 2027.

Overall, the FOMC remains committed to its dual mandate of supporting maximum employment and achieving its inflation target, while navigating the complexities of the current economic landscape. The next meeting is scheduled for January 28-29, 2025.
