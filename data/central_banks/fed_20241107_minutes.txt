The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) held a meeting on November 6-7, 2024, where they discussed various economic and financial developments. Key points from the meeting include:

1. **Financial Market Developments**: Treasury yields rose significantly due to stronger economic data and a perceived gradual approach to monetary policy easing. Equity prices also increased, reflecting improved economic outlooks. The federal funds rate path shifted upward, with expectations for a 25 basis point cut at the current and next meetings.

2. **Economic Conditions**: Real GDP growth remained solid, with moderate job gains and a low unemployment rate. Inflation, as measured by the PCE index, was below previous levels, with total inflation at 2.1% and core inflation at 2.7%. Labor market conditions were stable, although some temporary disruptions occurred due to strikes and natural disasters.

3. **International Developments**: Policy rate expectations declined in most advanced economies, contributing to a stronger U.S. dollar. Inflation abroad eased, particularly in advanced economies, while some Latin American countries faced rising inflation.

4. **Monetary Policy Actions**: The FOMC unanimously decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4.5% - 4.75%. They emphasized the need to monitor incoming data closely and adjust policies as necessary to support maximum employment and return inflation to the 2% target.

5. **Outlook and Risks**: The economic outlook was generally positive, with solid growth expected. However, participants noted potential risks, including geopolitical tensions and the possibility of a slowdown in economic activity. Inflation was seen as moving toward the target, but some participants cautioned about the persistence of elevated core inflation.

6. **Financial Stability Concerns**: Participants expressed concerns about vulnerabilities in the financial system, particularly regarding commercial real estate and the potential impact of rising interest rates on bank assets.

Overall, the FOMC's discussions reflected a cautious optimism about the economy while acknowledging the need for careful monitoring of inflation and employment trends. The next meeting is scheduled for December 17-18, 2024.
