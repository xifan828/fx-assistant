### Summary of ECB Press Conference - 17 October 2024

**Key Decisions:**
- The European Central Bank (ECB) Governing Council decided to lower the three key interest rates by 25 basis points, including the deposit facility rate. This decision reflects an updated assessment of the inflation outlook and the dynamics of underlying inflation.

**Economic Outlook:**
- Economic activity has been weaker than anticipated, with industrial production showing volatility and manufacturing continuing to contract. Service sector growth has slowed despite a boost from summer tourism.
- Household consumption has decreased, with a high saving rate of 15.7% in Q2, although there are signs of a gradual recovery in spending.
- The labor market remains resilient with an unemployment rate of 6.4%, but employment growth is slowing.

**Inflation Trends:**
- Annual inflation fell to 1.7% in September, the lowest since April 2021, driven by a sharp drop in energy prices. However, domestic inflation remains high due to rising wages.
- Inflation is expected to rise in the coming months before declining to the ECB's 2% target next year, supported by easing labor cost pressures and the effects of previous monetary policy tightening.

**Risk Assessment:**
- Risks to economic growth are tilted to the downside, influenced by geopolitical tensions and potential trade disruptions. Upside risks to inflation could arise from unexpected wage increases or geopolitical events affecting energy prices.

**Financial and Monetary Conditions:**
- Short-term market interest rates have declined, but financing conditions remain restrictive. Demand for loans has increased for the first time in two years, and mortgage lending has slightly picked up.

**Future Outlook:**
- The ECB will continue to adopt a data-dependent approach in its monetary policy decisions, assessing economic and financial data on a meeting-by-meeting basis. There is no pre-commitment to a specific rate path.
- The Governing Council emphasized the importance of fiscal and structural policies to enhance productivity and competitiveness in the euro area.

**Conclusion:**
- The ECB remains focused on ensuring inflation returns to the 2% target while navigating a complex economic landscape. The decision to cut rates reflects confidence in the ongoing disinflationary process, but the Council is prepared to adjust its policies as new data emerges.
