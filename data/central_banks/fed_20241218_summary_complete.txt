## Federal Open Market Committee US

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) recently convened and made key decisions regarding monetary policy in response to current economic conditions. Here are the main points from their latest statement and minutes:

1. **Economic Activity**: Economic activity continues to expand at a solid pace, although labor market conditions have eased slightly, with the unemployment rate increasing but still remaining low. Inflation is progressing towards the Committee's 2% target but is still somewhat elevated.

2. **Monetary Policy Adjustment**: The FOMC decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4.25% to 4.50%. This decision reflects a careful assessment of incoming data and the evolving economic outlook.

3. **Inflation and Employment Goals**: The Committee remains committed to achieving maximum employment and maintaining inflation at 2% over the long term. They noted that risks to these goals are roughly balanced, but the economic outlook remains uncertain.

4. **Financial Market Developments**: Treasury yields have seen a slight increase, and market expectations indicated a strong likelihood of the rate cut. The U.S. dollar has strengthened due to diverging interest rate expectations compared to other advanced economies.

5. **Future Outlook**: The FOMC anticipates solid economic conditions ahead, with GDP growth projected to be slightly slower than previous forecasts. However, inflation risks are tilted to the upside, necessitating a cautious approach to future monetary policy adjustments.

6. **Next Meeting**: The Committee will continue to monitor economic data closely and is scheduled to meet again on January 28-29, 2025.

In summary, the FOMC is taking a measured approach to monetary policy, balancing the need to support economic growth while addressing ongoing inflation concerns.
