        "rate": "Based on the data, the Fed held rates at 4.5%, adopting a patient \"wait-and-see\" approach, while the PBoC kept its 1Y LPR at 3.1%, maintaining record lows and a stimulus bias.\n\nThis creates a significant positive rate differential favoring the USD. The Fed is perceived as relatively more hawkish, holding higher rates, compared to the PBoC's relatively more dovish stance with low rates and ongoing stimulus efforts.\n\nThis divergence in policy and rate levels supports USD/CNH. While Fed projections imply future cuts are priced, the PBoC's low rate base and potential for further easing if needed mean the relative dovishness persists, underpinning the current USD/CNH direction driven by the differential.",
        "inflation": "US inflation (PCE 2.3%, Core PCE 2.6%) remains positive, albeit moderating, keeping the Fed cautious about easing. In contrast, China faces deflationary pressures (CPI -0.1%, Core CPI 0.5%), highlighting weak demand and an easing bias for the PBoC. Stronger inflation pressures in the US mean the Fed faces more risk of delaying cuts than the PBoC, which is pressured to ease. This divergence in relative rate paths, with US rates likely staying higher than China's, supports a stronger USD against the CNH.",
        "growth": "US Q1 GDP contracted sharply (-0.3%), signaling a significant slowdown, while manufacturing remains weak. China's Q1 GDP growth slowed (1.2%), and April manufacturing contracted. However, March retail sales and industrial production showed resilience.\n\nCompared to China's mixed but still positive growth and stimulus efforts, the US economy exhibits a more pronounced slowdown based on the GDP print. This divergence in macro momentum suggests relative weakness for the USD against the CNH.\n\nConsequently, the data points towards potential downside pressure on the USD/CNH pair.",
        "employment": "US labor data shows solid job growth (NFP beat) and stable unemployment (4.2%), though wage gains moderated slightly (AHE miss). This suggests a resilient market, supporting the Fed's cautious stance on rate cuts, implying rates may stay higher for longer.\n\nChina's unemployment rate improved slightly to 5.2% in March, indicating some labor market stabilization. However, the broader economic context suggests potential for further policy support.\n\nThe divergence – US strength supporting tighter policy vs. China's need for potential easing – points to continued USD strength relative to CNH, suggesting upward pressure on USD/CNH.",
        "synthesis": "The US economy shows labor market resilience but a sharp growth slowdown, contrasting with China's deflationary pressures and mixed growth. This divergence, especially in inflation and policy bias, positions the PBoC as more likely to ease than the patient Fed. Markets anticipate the PBoC easing in the near term, while the Fed remains patient."
