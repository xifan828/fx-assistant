        "rate": "Based on the data, the Bank of England is perceived as more dovish, having cut rates in May (4.25%) with a strong MPC vote favouring further easing (7/9). The Fed held rates (4.5%) and maintains a patient, data-dependent stance, appearing relatively less dovish.\n\nThis divergence is widening the rate differential in favour of the USD. Market pricing reflects expectations for more aggressive BoE cuts compared to the Fed. The widening negative rate differential for GBP is bearish for GBP/USD, suggesting potential downside pressure on the pair.",
        "inflation": "UK March inflation data showed further slowing (CPI 2.6%, Core 3.4%), yet core remains relatively high. US March PCE data also eased (PCE 2.3%, Core 2.6%), with core now below the UK's.\n\nThis indicates inflation pressures are currently stronger in the UK, suggesting the Bank of England faces more significant inflation risk than the Federal Reserve. Consequently, the BoE may delay rate cuts or proceed more cautiously than the Fed. This potential divergence in monetary policy paths, with the BoE remaining relatively more hawkish, should provide support for GBP/USD.",
        "growth": "Based on the data, the US economy shows a clear slowdown with Q1 GDP contracting sharply and manufacturing activity remaining in contraction. In contrast, the UK economy appears more resilient, posting positive Q4 GDP and strong Q1 retail sales growth.\n\nThis divergence indicates stronger relative macro momentum for the UK compared to the US. Consequently, this growth differential is likely to exert upward pressure on the GBP/USD exchange rate.",
        "employment": "UK labor data is mixed: strong employment growth contrasts with stable/high unemployment (4.4%) and elevated, though slightly easing, wage growth (5.6%). This suggests some underlying slack but persistent wage pressure, keeping the BoE cautious. US labor is solid: strong job gains (177k), low unemployment (4.2%), and moderating wage growth (3.8%). This points to a strong but cooling market, reducing inflation risks and giving the Fed room but no urgency for cuts. The relative strength and clearer wage disinflation in the US compared to the UK implies the Fed may be less dovish than the BoE, supporting the USD. GBP/USD faces downward pressure.",
        "synthesis": "The UK economy shows mixed signals with resilient growth but sticky inflation, while the US economy is slowing but has better inflation trends. The Bank of England, having already cut rates, appears more likely to ease further than the patient Federal Reserve. Markets expect the BoE to ease again in August, while the Fed may wait until September."
