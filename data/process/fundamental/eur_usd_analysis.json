        "rate": "Based on the data, the ECB recently cut rates to 2.25%, confirming a dovish stance and data-dependent path with no commitment to further easing. The Fed, however, held rates at 4.25%-4.50%, adopting a patient, wait-and-see approach amid uncertainty.\n\nThis divergence positions the ECB as more dovish than the Fed. The significant rate differential favoring the USD creates downward pressure on EUR/USD. Market expectations likely price in more potential easing from the ECB relative to the Fed, or a delayed cutting cycle for the Fed, reinforcing the negative outlook for the pair driven by yield differentials.",
        "inflation": "Based on the data, Euro Area core inflation (April: 2.7%) unexpectedly rose, while US core PCE (March: 2.6%) continued to ease. This indicates stronger *recent* inflationary pressure in the Euro Area.\n\nConsequently, the ECB faces more immediate inflation risk, potentially complicating or delaying rate cuts compared to the Fed, which sees easing pressures. This divergence in inflation trends and central bank outlooks implies a relatively less dovish ECB versus a Fed still on an easing path. This dynamic is generally supportive for EUR/USD, suggesting potential for the pair to find a floor or edge higher.",
        "growth": "Eurozone Q1 GDP accelerated to 0.4%, beating expectations and showing resilience driven by domestic demand. In contrast, the US economy contracted by 0.3% (annualized) in Q1, a sharp slowdown influenced by tariff-driven import surges and cooling consumer spending. US manufacturing also remains in contraction (ISM 48.7), facing tariff headwinds.\n\nRelative macro momentum clearly favors the Eurozone over the US based on this data. The significant divergence in Q1 growth, coupled with ongoing US manufacturing weakness, suggests stronger underlying performance in the Eurozone. This macro picture is fundamentally supportive of EUR/USD, implying potential upward pressure on the pair.",
        "employment": "Euro Area unemployment is stable at a low 6.2%, while wage growth is slowing from elevated levels (4.12% in Q4). This supports the ECB's easing bias. The US labor market remains robust with unemployment at 4.2% and solid NFP (177k), though wage growth is stable/slightly moderating (3.8% YoY). The resilient US labor market suggests the Fed may be less aggressive with rate cuts than the ECB. This divergence in policy outlook, with the ECB more likely to ease sooner/faster, is bearish for EUR/USD.",
        "synthesis": "The Eurozone economy shows stronger growth momentum than the US, although recent Euro Area inflation rose while US inflation eased. The ECB has already cut rates and faces slowing wage growth, positioning it as more likely to ease further than the Fed, which maintains a patient stance amid a robust labor market. Markets expect the ECB to ease in June, while the Fed may wait until September."
