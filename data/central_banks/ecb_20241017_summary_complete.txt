On October 17, 2024, the European Central Bank (ECB) Governing Council announced a reduction of the three key interest rates by 25 basis points, reflecting a reassessment of the inflation outlook and underlying inflation dynamics. The new rates will take effect on October 23, 2024, with the deposit facility rate set at 3.25%, the main refinancing operations at 3.40%, and the marginal lending facility at 3.65%.

The decision comes amid weaker-than-expected economic activity, characterized by volatility in industrial production and a contraction in manufacturing, while service sector growth has slowed despite summer tourism boosts. Household consumption has declined, with a high saving rate of 15.7% in Q2, although signs of gradual recovery in spending are emerging. The labor market remains resilient with an unemployment rate of 6.4%, but employment growth is slowing.

Inflation trends indicate a drop to 1.7% in September, the lowest since April 2021, primarily due to falling energy prices. However, domestic inflation persists due to rising wages. The ECB anticipates inflation to rise in the coming months before returning to the 2% target next year, aided by easing labor cost pressures and the effects of prior monetary policy tightening.

The Governing Council acknowledges downside risks to economic growth from geopolitical tensions and potential trade disruptions, while upside inflation risks may arise from unexpected wage increases or energy price shocks. Although short-term market interest rates have decreased, financing conditions remain restrictive, with a slight uptick in loan demand and mortgage lending.

The ECB will maintain a data-dependent approach to its monetary policy, assessing economic and financial data on a meeting-by-meeting basis without committing to a specific rate path. The Governing Council emphasizes the importance of fiscal and structural policies to enhance productivity and competitiveness in the euro area.

In conclusion, the ECB is focused on ensuring inflation returns to its 2% target while navigating a complex economic environment, with readiness to adjust policies as new data becomes available.
