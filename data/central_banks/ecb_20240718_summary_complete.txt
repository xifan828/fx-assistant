## European Central Bank

On July 18, 2024, the European Central Bank (ECB) announced that it would maintain its three key interest rates unchanged at 4.25%, 4.50%, and 3.75% for the main refinancing operations, marginal lending facility, and deposit facility, respectively. This decision underscores the ECB's commitment to a restrictive monetary policy aimed at returning inflation to its medium-term target of 2%.

The economic outlook indicates that while the euro area economy is growing, it is doing so at a slower pace compared to the first quarter of 2024, primarily driven by the services sector. However, industrial production and goods exports are weak, and investment growth is expected to remain muted due to increased uncertainty. The labor market shows resilience with an unemployment rate of 6.4%, mainly supported by job creation in the services sector.

Inflation insights reveal that annual inflation eased slightly to 2.5% in June, with rising food prices and stable energy prices. Despite high domestic inflation pressures driven by wage growth and unit labor costs, profits have contracted, helping to mitigate some inflationary effects. Inflation is anticipated to fluctuate around current levels for the remainder of the year but is projected to decline towards the target in the second half of 2025.

The ECB assessed risks to economic growth as tilted to the downside, influenced by global economic conditions and geopolitical tensions. Upside risks to inflation could arise from potential wage and profit increases, while downside risks may stem from stronger-than-expected monetary policy effects or deteriorating global conditions.

Financial conditions remain restrictive, with weak credit dynamics. While the average interest rate on new loans to firms has decreased slightly, mortgage rates have remained unchanged. Demand for loans from firms has declined, whereas demand for mortgages from households has increased.

Looking ahead, the ECB emphasizes a data-dependent approach for future interest rate decisions, with no predetermined rate path. The Governing Council will closely monitor economic data, including inflation, wage growth, and productivity, to inform future policy adjustments.

In conclusion, the ECB remains steadfast in its commitment to achieving its inflation target while navigating the complexities of economic growth and external pressures, with future decisions guided by comprehensive data analysis.
