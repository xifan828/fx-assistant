## Federal Open Market Committee US

The latest statement from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) indicates that the U.S. economy is expanding at a solid pace, although job gains have slowed and the unemployment rate has increased slightly, yet it remains low. Inflation is progressing towards the Committee's 2% target but is still considered elevated.

The FOMC is committed to achieving maximum employment and maintaining inflation at 2% over the long term. They express increased confidence that inflation is moving sustainably towards this target and believe that the risks to both employment and inflation goals are balanced. However, they acknowledge the uncertainty in the economic outlook and remain vigilant to potential risks.

In response to the progress on inflation and the balanced risks, the Committee has decided to lower the federal funds rate target range by 0.5 percentage points to 4.75% to 5%. Future adjustments to this target will depend on incoming data and the evolving economic outlook. The Committee will also continue to reduce its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt.

The FOMC emphasizes its commitment to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to the 2% objective. They will monitor a wide range of information, including labor market conditions and inflation pressures, to assess the appropriate stance of monetary policy. The Committee is prepared to adjust its policy if necessary to meet its goals.

The voting members for this monetary policy action included Jerome H. Powell (Chair), John C. Williams (Vice Chair), and several others, while Michelle W. Bowman voted against the action, preferring a smaller rate cut of 0.25 percentage points.
