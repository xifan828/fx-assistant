### Summary of ECB Press Conference - December 12, 2024

**Key Decisions:**
- The European Central Bank (ECB) decided to lower the three key interest rates by 25 basis points, particularly the deposit facility rate, reflecting a positive assessment of the inflation outlook and monetary policy transmission.

**Inflation Outlook:**
- Headline inflation is projected to average 2.4% in 2024, decreasing to 2.1% in 2025 and 1.9% in 2026, with a return to 2.1% in 2027.
- Underlying inflation is expected to stabilize around the 2% target, although domestic inflation remains high at 4.2%, primarily due to wage pressures and delayed adjustments in certain sectors.

**Economic Growth:**
- Economic growth is anticipated to be slower than previously expected, with projections of 0.7% growth in 2024, 1.1% in 2025, and 1.4% in 2026.
- The labor market remains resilient, but job vacancies have decreased, indicating a potential slowdown in employment growth.

**Monetary Policy Approach:**
- The ECB will adopt a data-dependent approach for future interest rate decisions, without committing to a specific rate path.
- The removal of the reference to maintaining restrictive policies indicates a shift towards a more flexible monetary stance, although the current policy remains restrictive.

**Risks to the Economy:**
- Risks to economic growth are tilted to the downside, influenced by global trade tensions, geopolitical risks, and the potential for prolonged effects of past monetary tightening.
- Inflation risks are now seen as two-sided, with potential for both higher and lower inflation outcomes depending on various factors, including wage growth and geopolitical tensions.

**Financial Conditions:**
- Market interest rates have declined, easing financing conditions for firms and households, although they remain tight overall.
- Bank lending has shown gradual improvement, with increased borrowing by firms and households.

**Conclusion:**
- The ECB is committed to ensuring inflation stabilizes at the 2% target and will adjust its monetary policy tools as necessary to achieve this goal. The focus remains on data-driven decisions in response to evolving economic conditions. 

**Q&A Highlights:**
- ECB officials emphasized the importance of not pre-committing to future rate cuts and maintaining flexibility in response to incoming data.
- Concerns about trade tensions and political instability in member states were acknowledged, but the ECB's primary focus remains on price stability and its mandate.
