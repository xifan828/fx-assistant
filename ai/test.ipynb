      "The Euro Q3 Technical Forecast suggests a mixed picture for the EUR/USD pair. The Euro has exhibited a choppy downtrend in 2024, reacting to rate cut projections in the US and ECB. The pair may see a recovery in Q3 but remains uncertain due to French election concerns and Fed easing policy. The technical analysis indicates key resistance levels at 1.0929 and 1.1033, while support levels are at 1.0600 and 1.0516. The Euro may face challenges in gaining strength compared to other G7 currencies. Additionally, the Bank of England's potential rate cut could impact the EUR/GBP pair, with levels to watch at 0.8472 and 0.8720. The overall outlook suggests a recovery for EUR/GBP but allows for a possible initial move lower in Q3. \n",
