"The recent news highlights a strong bullish sentiment for the USD/JPY pair due to the U.S. dollar's strength, driven by high U.S. Treasury yields and expectations of sustained high interest rates by the Federal Reserve. The yen's weakness is noted, with a low probability of BoJ intervention in the near term.
