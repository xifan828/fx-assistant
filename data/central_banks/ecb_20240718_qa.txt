### Summary of ECB Press Conference (18 July 2024)

**Key Decisions:**
- The ECB's Governing Council decided to keep the three key interest rates unchanged.
- The decision reflects a commitment to maintaining restrictive monetary policy until inflation returns to the medium-term target of 2%.

**Economic Outlook:**
- The euro area economy is growing, albeit at a slower pace than in the first quarter of 2024, primarily driven by the services sector.
- Industrial production and goods exports are weak, with muted investment growth expected in 2024 due to heightened uncertainty.
- The labor market remains resilient, with an unemployment rate of 6.4% and job creation primarily in the services sector.

**Inflation Insights:**
- Annual inflation eased slightly to 2.5% in June, with food prices rising and energy prices stable.
- Domestic inflation pressures remain high, driven by elevated wage growth and unit labor costs, although profits have contracted, helping to offset inflationary effects.
- Inflation is expected to fluctuate around current levels for the remainder of the year but is projected to decline towards the target in the second half of 2025.

**Risk Assessment:**
- Economic growth risks are tilted to the downside, influenced by global economic conditions and geopolitical tensions.
- Upside risks to inflation include potential wage and profit increases, while downside risks could arise from stronger-than-expected monetary policy effects or worsening global economic conditions.

**Financial and Monetary Conditions:**
- Financing conditions remain restrictive, with credit dynamics weak. The average interest rate on new loans to firms decreased slightly, while mortgage rates remained unchanged.
- Demand for loans from firms has declined, while demand for mortgages from households has increased.

**Future Considerations:**
- The ECB emphasizes a data-dependent approach for future interest rate decisions, with no predetermined rate path.
- The Governing Council will closely monitor economic data, including inflation, wage growth, and productivity, to inform future policy adjustments.

**Responses to Questions:**
- ECB officials addressed concerns about wage growth, fiscal policies, and the impact of external factors such as U.S. trade tensions on the euro area economy.
- The importance of national fiscal policies in enhancing productivity and competitiveness was highlighted, alongside the need for effective implementation of the Next Generation EU program.

**Conclusion:**
- The ECB remains committed to achieving its inflation target while navigating the complexities of economic growth and external pressures. Future decisions will be guided by comprehensive data analysis and ongoing assessments of economic conditions.
