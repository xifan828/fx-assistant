## Federal Open Market Committee US

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has announced that economic activity is expanding at a solid pace, although labor market conditions have eased slightly, with a modest increase in the unemployment rate, which remains low. Inflation is progressing towards the Committee's 2% target but is still elevated.

The FOMC aims for maximum employment and a long-term inflation rate of 2%. Currently, the risks to achieving these goals are considered balanced. However, the economic outlook remains uncertain, prompting the Committee to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 0.25 percentage points to a range of 4.5% to 4.75%. 

The Committee will continue to evaluate incoming data and the evolving economic outlook when considering further adjustments to the federal funds rate. Additionally, it will persist in reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt, as well as agency mortgage-backed securities. The FOMC is committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to its target.

In its ongoing assessment of monetary policy, the Committee will monitor various factors, including labor market conditions, inflation pressures, and international developments. The voting members for this monetary policy action included Jerome H. Powell (Chair), John C. Williams (Vice Chair), and several other key officials.
