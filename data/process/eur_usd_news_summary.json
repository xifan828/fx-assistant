        "summary": "Key forex-relevant insights from the article:\n\n- The US dollar gained slightly against the euro (EUR/USD down 0.04% to 1.1384) and yen (USD/JPY up 0.77% to 143.72), marking its first weekly rise in over a month amid easing US-China trade war tensions.\n\n- China exempted some US imports from tariffs, easing fears of a prolonged trade conflict, which has improved risk sentiment and supported equities.\n\n- Market sentiment shows relief that the worst-case tariff scenarios may not materialize, but uncertainty remains, suggesting EUR/USD may trade in a range near current levels.\n\n- The dollar’s modest strength reflects cautious optimism but not a full risk-on shift; safe haven demand for gold declined nearly 2%, indicating some risk appetite returning.\n\n- US 10-year Treasury yields fell slightly, which may temper dollar gains but also reflect lingering uncertainty.\n\nImplications for EUR/USD traders:\n\n- Trade war developments remain key drivers; further easing could weigh on the dollar and support EUR/USD upside.\n\n- Conversely, renewed tariff threats or escalation would likely boost the dollar and pressure EUR/USD lower.\n\n- Current market positioning suggests EUR/USD may consolidate around 1.13-1.14 until clearer trade policy signals emerge.\n\n- Watch for shifts in risk sentiment and US-China trade news as primary catalysts for EUR/USD volatility in the near term."

        "summary": "Key forex-relevant insights from the article on EUR/USD technicals:\n\n- EUR/USD attempted to break above the 200-hour moving average (MA) multiple times but failed to sustain momentum, indicating strong resistance near 1.1388.\n- The pair pulled back after nearing the 200-hour MA, currently trading around 1.1373, suggesting sellers are active below this technical barrier.\n- Support was found near recent lows around 1.1314-1.1307, which could act as a short-term floor.\n- The 100-hour MA is moving toward the 200-hour MA, signaling a potential convergence that traders often watch for shifts in trend or momentum.\n- Overall, the inability to hold above the 200-hour MA and the proximity of key moving averages may keep EUR/USD range-bound or biased lower in the near term unless a decisive breakout occurs.\n- No fundamental or macroeconomic drivers were mentioned, so technical resistance at the 200-hour MA is the primary focus for near-term EUR/USD price action.\n\nTraders should monitor the 200-hour MA as a key resistance level and watch for any changes in momentum or breakout attempts that could influence EUR/USD valuations."

        "summary": "Key forex-relevant insights from the article:\n\n- The US dollar is set for its first weekly gain since mid-March, supported by signs of easing US-China trade tensions.\n- China granted some tariff exemptions on US imports, raising hopes of de-escalation in the trade war, though overall clarity remains limited.\n- US President Trump confirmed ongoing tariff deal talks with China, including a call from Xi Jinping, but Beijing disputes the US characterization.\n- The dollar rose modestly against a currency basket (DXY +0.07% on the day), with USD/JPY up 0.67% to 143.555 and EUR/USD down 0.11% to 1.1377.\n- Market strategist Fiona Cincotta notes a shift from escalation toward de-escalation but cautions it’s too early to confirm a dollar recovery.\n- Progress in US trade talks with Japan and South Korea is noted, though no currency manipulation discussions with Japan yet.\n- MUFG strategist Derek Halpenny warns that despite tariff easing, US growth will be impacted, maintaining volatility and downside pressure on equity markets, which is unfavorable for sustained USD/JPY gains.\n- Bank of Japan maintains a cautious stance, expected to keep rates unchanged, but signals readiness to raise rates if inflation approaches target.\n- Overall, the news suggests a tentative improvement in risk sentiment and a modest dollar rebound, but uncertainties around trade and growth risks keep EUR/USD pressured near 1.13-1.14 levels."

This suggests a slight strengthening of the dollar amid easing trade war concerns.\n\n- US Treasury yields on 10-year notes fell to 4.268% amid hopes for easing US-China trade tensions and speculation that the Fed might pivot to lower interest rates if economic growth slows. Lower yields typically weigh on the dollar, but here the dollar still gained, indicating mixed signals.\n\n- Market sentiment improved with tech stocks rallying (Nasdaq +1.07%) on strong earnings (e.g., Alphabet beating profit expectations), reflecting risk-on appetite which can pressure safe-haven currencies like the euro.\n\n- Conflicting signals on US-China trade talks persist: Trump claims negotiations are underway, but China denies talks, maintaining uncertainty that could keep forex volatility elevated.\n\n- European equities (STOXX 600 +0.35% on the day, +2% weekly) also rose, but the euro weakened slightly versus the dollar, indicating that US factors and dollar demand currently dominate EUR/USD moves.\n\nImplications for EUR/USD traders:\n- The dollar’s modest rebound amid easing trade war fears and potential Fed easing suggests EUR/USD may face downward pressure near term.\n- Continued uncertainty around US-China talks could cause volatility spikes.\n- Watch US Treasury yields and Fed commentary closely as shifts could quickly alter dollar strength.\n- Tech sector strength and risk-on sentiment support dollar demand, potentially limiting euro gains despite European equity strength."

EUR/USD fell 0.11% to 1.1377, while USD/JPY rose 0.67% to 143.555. This modest dollar strength reflects cautious investor optimism amid mixed signals on US-China trade talks.\n\n- Conflicting statements from the US and China on trade negotiations continue to create uncertainty. President Trump claimed talks were underway and that Xi Jinping had called him, but China denied negotiations. This ongoing ambiguity keeps risk sentiment fragile, limiting strong directional moves in EUR/USD.\n\n- US Treasury yields declined slightly (10-year yield down 3.7 bps to 4.268%), reflecting hopes for easing trade tensions and potential Fed rate cuts amid slowing economic activity. Lower yields typically weigh on the dollar, but here the dollar still gained modestly, indicating mixed market signals.\n\n- Equity markets rose, led by tech stocks, supported by strong corporate earnings (e.g., Alphabet beating profit expectations). Positive earnings and easing trade war fears have improved risk appetite, which can pressure safe-haven currencies like the USD and EUR.\n\n- Market commentary suggests relief that the worst-case tariff scenarios may be avoided, but investors remain cautious, expecting EUR/USD to trade in a range rather than trend strongly.\n\nImplications for EUR/USD traders:\n- The pair faces downward pressure from a slightly stronger dollar amid cautious optimism on trade talks.\n- Uncertainty and conflicting trade signals limit strong trends; expect range-bound trading near current levels.\n- Watch for upcoming US corporate earnings and further trade developments for potential volatility.\n- Fed policy expectations and US Treasury yields remain key drivers; any shift toward easing could weaken the dollar and support EUR/USD."

This signals US economic resilience, supporting USD strength.\n\n- Optimism on easing US-China trade tensions: China open to talks, US willingness to negotiate on tariffs. This reduces global risk aversion, potentially benefiting risk-sensitive currencies like EUR.\n\n- US Treasury yields rose (10-year up 4bps to 4.27%) as bond prices fell, pressured by stronger economic data and concerns Japan may use US debt holdings as leverage in trade talks. Higher yields typically support USD.\n\n- Despite strong US data, the USD weakened slightly post-jobs report, trading down 1% vs. JPY and EUR/USD up 0.3% to 1.1327, indicating some profit-taking or risk-on sentiment.\n\n- European equities rallied strongly (DAX +2.4%, FTSE +1%), reflecting improved risk appetite, which can support EUR.\n\n- Longer-term concerns remain about tariffs hurting US corporate earnings and economic outlook, potentially limiting USD upside.\n\nImplications for EUR/USD:\n- Near-term USD strength from solid labor data and rising yields may be capped by easing trade tensions and improved risk sentiment favoring EUR.\n- EUR/USD likely to see modest gains amid risk-on mood but remains sensitive to US tariff developments and Treasury yield moves.\n- Traders should watch US tariff policy updates and Treasury yields as key drivers of EUR/USD direction."

        "summary": "Key forex-relevant insights from the FAO April global food price report:\n\n- Global food prices rose 1% month-on-month in April, driven by higher cereals, meat, and dairy prices, offsetting declines in sugar and vegetable oils.\n- Cereal prices increased 1.2% due to tighter US corn stocks, higher rice demand, and reduced Russian wheat exports, though overall cereal prices remain slightly below last year.\n- Meat prices rose 3.2%, led by pork and bovine meat due to stronger EU import demand after Germany’s foot-and-mouth disease status update and seasonal Easter demand.\n- Dairy prices surged 2.4% month-on-month and 22.9% year-on-year, driven by record-high European butter prices amid low inventories and strong milkfat demand.\n- Sugar and vegetable oil prices fell (3.5% and 2.3%, respectively), pressured by Brazil’s higher sugar output, a weaker Brazilian real, and lower crude oil prices.\n- The report signals ongoing supply tightness in key staples (cereals, meat, dairy), supporting inflationary pressures globally.\n- For EUR/USD, rising food prices—especially in Europe—may reinforce ECB’s hawkish stance amid inflation concerns, potentially supporting EUR strength.\n- Conversely, weaker commodity-linked currencies (e.g., Brazilian real) and lower oil prices could weigh on USD sentiment, adding complexity.\n- Market sentiment may tilt towards risk-off if inflation fears intensify, impacting EUR/USD volatility.\n\nIn summary, persistent food inflation driven by cereals, meat, and dairy price increases—especially in Europe—could bolster the euro via ECB hawkish expectations, while mixed commodity price trends and global economic uncertainty may keep USD demand nuanced."

This boosted US Treasury yields and reduced expectations for a Fed rate cut in June, typically supporting USD strength.\n\n2. **Dollar Weakness Despite Strong Data**: Despite strong employment and rising yields, the dollar index dipped slightly (-0.08%) as risk appetite improved on easing trade tensions, with EUR/USD edging up to 1.1295. This suggests a short-term risk-on mood benefiting the euro.\n\n3. **Trade Tensions Easing**: China’s openness to trade talks and a potential de-escalation of US-China tariffs improved market sentiment. Experts noted the \"spiraling-out-of-control phase ended,\" reducing downside risks for global growth and supporting risk currencies like the euro.\n\n4. **Rising Treasury Yields**: 10-year yields rose to 4.33%, 2-year yields to 3.84%, reflecting less likelihood of Fed cuts. Higher US yields typically support USD, but current market focus on trade optimism is tempering dollar gains.\n\n5. **Market Sentiment Shift**: European and US stocks rallied strongly, indicating improved risk appetite. This environment often weighs on the safe-haven USD and supports EUR/USD upside.\n\n6. **Japan’s Potential Use of US Debt Holdings in Trade Talks**: Adds geopolitical uncertainty but no immediate impact on EUR/USD.\n\n**Summary for EUR/USD traders**: Strong US jobs data and rising yields underpin USD fundamentals, but easing US-China trade tensions and improved risk sentiment are currently supporting the euro and limiting dollar gains.

        "summary": "Key forex-relevant insights from the Reuters article:\n\n- **US Labor Market Strength**: US jobs data exceeded expectations with stronger employment and lower-than-expected wage inflation. This boosted US Treasury yields sharply, reducing market bets on a Fed rate cut in June.

EUR/USD rose modestly (+0.12% to 1.1304), suggesting some euro resilience amid easing trade tensions.\n\n- **Trade Tensions Easing**: China signaled openness to trade talks with the US, raising hopes for tariff de-escalation. This improved risk appetite, lifting global stocks and reducing safe-haven demand for USD and gold.\n\n- **Market Sentiment**: Global equities rallied strongly, with US and European indices up over 1%, reflecting optimism on trade and solid US economic data. This risk-on mood can weigh on USD safe-haven flows, supporting EUR/USD.\n\n- **Expert Views**: Strategists note the US economy is performing well despite tariffs, and the worst phase of the US-China trade war may be over. Market participants expect current tariff levels to be temporary.\n\n- **Implications for EUR/USD**: The combination of strong US data (USD positive) and easing trade tensions (risk-on, EUR positive) creates mixed but slightly supportive conditions for EUR/USD gains near 1.13. Watch for further US-China trade developments and Fed policy signals for directional cues.\n\nIn summary, strong US jobs data supports USD via higher yields, but improved US-China trade outlook and risk appetite favor EUR/USD upside.

        "summary": "Key forex-relevant insights from the Reuters article on the Fed decision:\n\n- The Fed held rates steady, signaling a \"wait and see\" approach amid rising risks of both higher inflation and unemployment, complicating the economic outlook.\n- The Fed highlighted that Q1 growth was solid but impacted by tariff-driven import front-loading; labor market remains solid; inflation \"somewhat elevated.\"\n- Fed Chair Powell emphasized no rush to change policy, awaiting data on tariff impacts.\n- Market reaction: USD initially dipped but then strengthened; EUR/USD declined about 0.5%.\n- Experts note the Fed is caught in a stagflation dilemma—balancing inflation risks against slowing growth and potential rising unemployment.\n- Most analysts expect the Fed to remain on hold through summer, with possible rate cuts delayed until late Q3 or beyond, contingent on economic data and tariff developments.\n- The Fed’s messaging signals caution about tariff-related economic risks, with uncertainty over whether inflation or growth concerns will dominate policy decisions.\n- Market consensus for multiple rate cuts this year may be premature; many strategists expect cuts only if growth disappoints significantly.\n- The Fed’s stance and tariff tensions are key drivers for USD sentiment; unresolved trade issues could increase risk aversion and USD strength as a safe haven.\n- Overall, the Fed’s neutral but cautious tone amid tariff uncertainty suggests EUR/USD downside risk if growth fears intensify or inflation remains sticky.\n\nFor EUR/USD traders, the main takeaway is that the Fed’s patient stance amid stagflation risks and tariff uncertainty supports USD strength in the near term, while any escalation in trade tensions or worsening data could further pressure EUR/USD lower. Conversely, clear signs of economic slowdown might eventually prompt Fed easing, potentially benefiting EUR/USD later in the year."

        "summary": "Key forex-relevant insights from Fed Chair Powell’s comments:\n\n- Powell adopts a “wait and see” stance on the impact of tariffs on inflation and unemployment, emphasizing uncertainty around tariff negotiations and their economic effects.\n- Current tariff levels could delay Fed’s goals by increasing unemployment and inflation, but so far these risks have not materialized in the data.\n- Inflation progress is “moving along well,” and the cost of waiting before adjusting policy is considered “fairly low.”\n- Powell highlights limited Fed tools to address supply chain issues that might boost inflation, signaling potential challenges ahead.\n- The Fed remains data-dependent, focusing on whichever mandate (inflation or employment) needs more attention, with no immediate need to prioritize one over the other.\n- Powell stresses that any Fed reaction would require a “significant deterioration” in jobs, indicating a tolerance for some labor market weakening before tightening policy.\n- Uncertainty around tariffs and their economic impact is a key factor restraining preemptive Fed action.\n- Overall, Powell’s cautious tone and emphasis on uncertainty suggest a potential pause or slower pace in Fed tightening, which could weigh on USD strength and support EUR/USD gains if tariff risks ease.\n\nTraders should monitor tariff negotiation developments and incoming inflation/employment data for clearer signals on Fed policy direction."

        "summary": "Key forex-relevant insights from the article:\n\n- The Federal Reserve kept interest rates steady at 4.25%-4.50%, as expected, but signaled increased risks of higher inflation and unemployment, maintaining a cautious, somewhat hawkish tone.\n- Fed Chair Powell emphasized no preemptive rate moves until clearer economic data emerges, suggesting an extended hold period.\n- The U.S. dollar strengthened modestly against the euro (EURUSD down 0.44% to 1.13165) and yen (USDJPY up 1% to 143.84), reflecting the Fed’s hawkish stance and uncertainty in the U.S. outlook.\n- Market experts note the Fed’s balancing act between inflation concerns and labor market slack, which has limited sharp FX moves post-decision.\n- Euro weakness may also be influenced by German political developments (Friedrich Merz elected chancellor) and ongoing ECB policy expectations.\n- Pound sterling weakened ahead of an anticipated Bank of England rate cut, adding to euro-dollar dynamics.\n- Trade tensions remain a risk factor: U.S.-China talks are scheduled but Trump’s reluctance to cut tariffs could sustain uncertainty, supporting the dollar as a safe haven.\n- Chinese yuan weakened after China’s rate cut, indicating easing monetary policy versus U.S. tightening.\n\nImplications for EURUSD traders:\n- The Fed’s hawkish hold and cautious outlook support dollar strength, pressuring EURUSD lower.\n- Political shifts in Germany and ECB policy stance add downside risk to the euro.\n- Trade tensions and global risk sentiment remain key drivers; any escalation could further boost the dollar.\n- Expect EURUSD to face resistance near current levels with potential for further declines unless U.S. data or Fed guidance turns dovish."

        "summary": "Key forex-relevant insights from the May 7 Forexlive Americas FX news wrap:\n\n- The Fed left rates unchanged as expected but acknowledged rising risks of higher unemployment and inflation, signaling a cautious stance.\n- Chair Powell described the US economy as “solid” with a balanced labor market but noted sharp declines in consumer and business sentiment, and uncertainty from trade, immigration, and regulatory policy shifts.\n- Powell emphasized patience and data-dependence, stating the Fed’s current policy stance is well-positioned and there is time to wait before adjusting rates; the cost of waiting is “fairly low.”\n- Inflation remains elevated partly due to tariffs, which Powell warned could drive inflation temporarily or persistently if sustained.\n- Powell did not commit to future rate cuts, highlighting uncertainty and the need for more clarity from incoming data.\n- US Treasury Secretary expects US debt-to-GDP ratio to decline next year, potentially easing fiscal concerns.\n- Market reaction: USD strengthened modestly against major currencies including EUR (+0.59%), while US Treasury yields fell slightly.\n- European equities closed lower, reflecting cautious risk sentiment.\n- Reports that Trump will not enforce AI diffusion rules on chip exports boosted US tech stocks late in the session, supporting risk appetite.\n- Overall, the Fed’s cautious, noncommittal tone and elevated uncertainty suggest limited near-term USD weakness; EURUSD may face headwinds from a resilient USD and ongoing geopolitical/trade uncertainties.\n\nForex traders should monitor upcoming US economic data for clearer signals on Fed policy direction and watch tariff developments as a key inflation risk factor impacting EURUSD valuations."

        "summary": "Key forex-relevant insights from the article:\n\n- EUR/USD traded lower early, hitting 1.1270, but recovered to just above 1.1300 amid large option expiries at that level, indicating potential technical support/resistance.\n\n- The Bank of England cut its bank rate by 25 bps to 4.25% as expected, but a split vote with two members dissenting to keep rates unchanged suggests a more hawkish stance than the cut implies. This hawkish signal boosted GBP/USD from 1.3250 to 1.3330.\n\n- The US-UK trade deal announcement by Trump is imminent, described as a \"full and comprehensive\" agreement, though details remain scarce. UK concessions on food and agriculture in exchange for lower auto tariffs are reported. This trade optimism is supporting risk sentiment, buoying European equities and US futures, which can indirectly pressure EUR/USD lower as USD steadies.\n\n- USD/JPY is rising toward 145.00, supported by higher US bond yields, reflecting stronger USD demand and risk-on sentiment.\n\n- Market focus remains on the US-UK trade deal announcement and ongoing US-China trade talks in Switzerland, both key for near-term risk appetite and EUR/USD direction.\n\nImplications for EUR/USD:\n\n- Positive US-UK trade developments and hawkish BOE signals supporting GBP may weigh on EUR/USD via USD strength and relative GBP outperformance.\n\n- Elevated US yields and risk-on sentiment favor USD over EUR, pressuring EUR/USD.\n\n- Technical support near 1.1300 is notable due to option expiries, so watch for price action around this level.\n\nTraders should monitor the US-UK trade deal details and US-China talks for shifts in risk sentiment that could drive EUR/USD volatility. The BOE vote split signals potential for less dovish UK monetary policy, indirectly influencing EUR/GBP and EUR/USD dynamics."

        "summary": "Key insights from Fed Governor Adriana Kugler at the NABE conference relevant to EUR/USD:\n\n- The US-China trade deal and 90-day truce signal reduced uncertainty and willingness to negotiate, which could ease risk sentiment and support USD strength.\n- Tariffs are expected to cause an initial supply shock followed by a demand shock, potentially disrupting global trade flows and impacting inflation dynamics.\n- Reduction in China tariffs may lessen the scale of monetary policy tightening but not change its overall direction, implying continued Fed vigilance.\n- Trade tensions could reduce productivity by shifting production to less efficient locations, potentially weighing on US growth.\n- There is a risk of lasting inflation expectations due to trade war effects, with some price increases possibly permanent, supporting a hawkish Fed stance.\n- Despite tariff reductions, Kugler expects higher inflation and lower growth, reinforcing expectations of cautious Fed policy.\n- The Fed remains data-dependent and well-positioned to adjust policy as needed.\n\nImplications for EUR/USD: Persistent US inflation concerns and cautious Fed tightening amid trade uncertainty may support USD strength, while easing trade tensions could improve risk appetite and benefit EUR. Traders should watch inflation data and trade developments closely."

        "summary": "Key forex market insights from the article impacting EUR/USD:\n\n- The US and China agreed to a 90-day truce reducing tariffs significantly (US tariffs on Chinese imports cut from 145% to 30%, China’s tariffs on US goods from 125% to 10%). This de-escalation eased fears of a global recession and boosted risk appetite.\n\n- The US dollar surged as a result, with the DXY index rising 1.2% to 101.58. EUR/USD dropped 1.17% to $1.1115, marking its largest one-day decline this year, reflecting dollar strength amid improved risk sentiment.\n\n- Market sentiment shifted to risk-on, lifting US equities (S&P 500 +2%) and weakening safe-haven currencies like the yen and Swiss franc against the dollar.\n\n- Expert view (Marc Chandler, Bannockburn Global Forex): The US “blinked” by rolling back tariffs without gaining much, signaling a pause rather than resolution, but this still supports the dollar short-term.\n\n- Traders reduced expectations for near-term Fed and ECB rate cuts due to improved economic outlook from the trade deal. The first Fed rate cut is now expected in September rather than July, supporting the dollar.\n\n- Upcoming US data (CPI on Tuesday, retail sales on Thursday) will be closely watched for signs of trade war impact and influence on Fed policy.\n\n- Geopolitical tensions eased with India-Pakistan ceasefire and potential Ukraine-Russia talks, further supporting risk sentiment and USD strength.\n\nImplications for EUR/USD traders:\n- The tariff truce and improved risk appetite favor USD strength and EUR/USD downside in the near term.\n- Reduced near-term rate cut expectations for Fed and ECB support the dollar relative to the euro.\n- Watch US inflation and retail sales data for cues on Fed policy and dollar momentum.\n- Geopolitical easing also supports risk-on flows, pressuring EUR/USD lower."

        "summary": "Key forex-relevant insights from the US-China tariff relief news:\n\n- The US and China agreed to a 90-day tariff reduction: US tariffs on Chinese imports cut from 145% to 30%, China’s from 125% to 10%. This de-escalation reduces trade war fears, improving global risk sentiment.\n\n- The US dollar strengthened notably: DXY index rose ~1.25%, USD/JPY surged 2.2% to 148.48, reflecting a risk-on move and safe-haven yen selling.\n\n- Euro weakened 1.2% to 1.1113 vs USD, reversing some earlier gains as the dollar regained appeal amid easing trade tensions.\n\n- Market experts view the tariff pause as a “substantial relief” but caution uncertainty remains until a final US-China deal is reached, limiting euro upside.\n\n- US Treasury yields rose (~8 bps on 10-year), signaling reduced safe-haven demand and improved growth outlook, supporting dollar strength.\n\n- Commodities and equities rallied (S&P 500 +3%, Nasdaq +4.1%, Brent crude +1.9%), reflecting optimism on trade and growth, which typically supports USD over EUR.\n\nImplications for EUR/USD:\n\n- Short-term downside pressure on EUR/USD due to dollar rebound on trade optimism and risk-on sentiment.\n\n- Continued uncertainty around US-China trade talks and US economic data could cause volatility; a definitive trade deal would likely sustain USD strength.\n\n- Traders should monitor US-China negotiations and US economic indicators for cues on risk sentiment shifts impacting EUR/USD."

        "summary": "Key forex-relevant insights from the US data:\n\n- Fed Senior Loan Officer Survey: Lending standards for commercial real estate unchanged in April; demand flat to weaker. For all firms, lending standards tightened and C&I loan demand weakened. This signals cautious credit conditions, potentially slowing US economic growth and dampening USD strength.\n\n- US Treasury Budget: April 2025 surplus at $258B vs $210B in April 2024, beating median forecast of $246B. However, year-to-date deficit widened to $1.049T from $855B last year, indicating higher fiscal deficits which could weigh on USD over time.\n\n- Treasury receipts and outlays both at record highs year-to-date, with strong tax receipts supporting government revenue. Interest on public debt rose slightly with a weighted average rate of 3.29%, reflecting ongoing debt servicing costs.\n\nImplications for EUR/USD:\n- Tighter lending standards and weaker loan demand may slow US growth, potentially weakening USD.\n- Larger fiscal deficits could add to USD downside pressure.\n- Strong tax receipts and budget surplus in April provide some fiscal support but may be offset by broader deficit trends.\nOverall, cautious US credit conditions and fiscal dynamics suggest potential USD softness, which could support EUR/USD upside in the near term."
