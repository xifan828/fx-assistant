            "risk_sentiment_analysis": "Global equity indices show a positive trend with the S&P 500 up 0.72% and Nasdaq gaining 1.58%, indicating a risk-on environment. The MSCI Emerging Markets is flat, suggesting cautious optimism in emerging markets. Commodity prices are rising, with Brent Oil up 2.39% and Gold up 0.82%, reflecting a mixed but generally supportive backdrop for risk assets. The VIX has decreased slightly by 0.92%, signaling reduced market volatility and increased risk appetite. Bond yields have risen modestly in both the US and Germany, with US yields higher than German yields but the spreads are very narrow (around 2 basis points), indicating limited divergence in monetary policy expectations between the US and Eurozone. Overall, the market sentiment is cautiously optimistic and tilted towards risk-on, supported by softer US inflation data and easing US-China trade tensions.",
            "key_market_drivers": "The primary market drivers are the softer-than-expected US inflation data which reduces the urgency for aggressive Fed tightening, and the 90-day US-China tariff pause which has eased trade war fears and boosted risk sentiment. Equities are responding positively to these developments, while commodity prices like Brent Oil and Gold are rising, reflecting improved economic confidence and some inflation concerns. The narrow yield spreads between US and German government bonds suggest a cautious but stable monetary policy outlook. The US dollar weakness, as seen in the DXY decline, is also a key factor supporting EUR/USD gains, driven by reduced expectations for Fed rate cuts and improved risk appetite.",
            "implications_for_trading": "The risk-on environment and narrowing US-Germany yield spreads support modest euro strength against the dollar, with EUR/USD approaching a key resistance near 1.1213. The slight rise in US yields relative to German yields limits the euro's upside but does not negate it, as the dollar is pressured by reduced Fed tightening expectations and tariff optimism. Traders should watch for a decisive break above 1.1213 to confirm further euro appreciation. Risks include lingering tariff-related inflationary pressures that could sustain dollar support and cap EUR/USD gains. The cautious Fed stance and mixed Eurozone growth forecasts add complexity, suggesting that while short-term upside exists, medium-term volatility and uncertainty remain.",
            "conclusion": "Market tone is cautiously optimistic with a risk-on tilt driven by softer US inflation and eased trade tensions, supporting modest EUR/USD gains near resistance. Traders should focus on Fed communications and trade developments as key catalysts, with a break above 1.1213 potentially signaling further euro strength amid a still uncertain macro backdrop.",

The STOXX50 data is missing but Japanese equities are reported to be up, supporting improved risk sentiment. Commodity prices like Brent Oil (+2.39%) and Gold (+0.82%) are rising, with Gold's increase suggesting some safe-haven demand persists but overall commodity strength aligns with risk-on sentiment. The VIX is down 0.92%, reinforcing reduced market volatility and risk appetite. US Treasury yields are slightly higher, with the 10Y yield up 0.31%, while Japanese yields decline, widening the US-Japan yield spreads marginally, reflecting stable but slightly elevated US interest rates relative to Japan. This yield differential supports USD strength but is tempered by cautious Fed outlook and softer inflation data.",
            "key_market_drivers": "The primary market drivers include softer-than-expected US inflation data reducing immediate Fed tightening fears, a 90-day US-China tariff truce boosting global risk sentiment and equities, and stable but slightly elevated US Treasury yields maintaining USD support. Equities gains and commodity price increases reflect improved risk appetite, while the yield spreads between US and Japan underpin USD/JPY dynamics. Technical levels near 148.7 resistance and 147.1 support for USD/JPY are critical, with market participants closely watching Fed communications and trade developments for directional cues.",
            "implications_for_trading": "The improved risk sentiment and tariff optimism reduce safe-haven demand for JPY, limiting its strength and causing short-term USD/JPY volatility around key technical levels. However, the cautious Fed stance with delayed rate cuts and stable Treasury yields cap USD downside, creating a nuanced environment where USD/JPY faces downward pressure from a softer USD but is supported by yield differentials. Traders should watch the 147.1 support and 148.7 resistance levels for potential breakouts or reversals, with medium-term expectations pointing to a gradual USD/JPY decline as Fed easing is delayed but anticipated later in the year.",
            "conclusion": "The market tone is cautiously risk-on, supported by softer US inflation and tariff truce optimism, but tempered by a cautious Fed outlook and stable yields. USD/JPY traders should prepare for near-term volatility within defined technical ranges, with a medium-term bias toward gradual USD moderation and potential pair depreciation as Fed rate cuts are priced in later this year.",

Commodity prices are supportive of risk appetite, with Brent Oil up 2.39% and Gold rising 0.82%, the latter often seen as a safe haven but here likely reflecting inflation concerns. The VIX has declined slightly, signaling reduced volatility and further supporting a risk-on sentiment. Bond yields show mixed signals: US 2Y and 10Y yields are slightly higher, while UK 2Y yields have fallen and UK 10Y yields have risen modestly. Yield spreads between US and UK bonds are minimal, suggesting limited interest rate differential impact currently. Overall, the market is cautiously optimistic, balancing softer US inflation data and improved trade sentiment against lingering tariff risks and central bank caution.",
            "key_market_drivers": "The primary drivers shaping the current market environment are the softer-than-expected US CPI inflation data which has weakened the dollar and boosted risk-sensitive currencies like GBP, the US-China tariff pause improving risk sentiment, and central bank communications delaying expected Fed rate cuts while the BoE signals potential for sustained higher rates. Equities gains and commodity price increases reinforce risk-on sentiment, while bond yields and yield spreads reflect cautious monetary policy expectations. Technical factors around GBP/USD resistance levels also play a significant role in near-term trading dynamics.",
            "implications_for_trading": "The observed risk-on sentiment combined with minimal US-UK yield spreads suggests limited carry advantage for GBP/USD but a favorable environment for GBP supported by improving UK macro conditions and cautious BoE stance. The weaker dollar due to softer US inflation and improved trade relations supports GBP/USD upside potential, especially if the pair breaks above the 200-hour moving average near 1.3284. Traders should watch for shifts in US inflation data and Fed signals that could strengthen the dollar and pressure GBP/USD lower. Risks include renewed tariff tensions or disappointing UK data that could undermine GBP. Overall, GBP/USD offers a near-term trading opportunity on a break above key technical resistance, with critical support at 1.3160 to manage downside risk.",
            "conclusion": "The market tone is cautiously optimistic with a tilt towards risk-on driven by softer US inflation and easing trade tensions, though central bank caution and tariff risks warrant vigilance. GBP/USD traders should focus on technical breakouts above resistance and monitor upcoming inflation and geopolitical developments for directional cues, balancing upside potential against downside risks from policy shifts or renewed trade concerns.",

The VIX has declined slightly, reinforcing reduced market volatility. US Treasury yields have risen modestly, with the 10Y yield up 0.31%, while Chinese yields show mixed moves, with the 2Y yield down 2.14% and the 10Y yield up 0.90%, narrowing US-China yield spreads to around 2.6-2.8 basis points, signaling a modest interest rate differential favoring the US. Overall, the market exhibits cautious optimism driven by easing geopolitical tensions and the US-China tariff truce, supporting a slightly risk-on stance.",
            "key_market_drivers": "The primary market drivers include the US-China tariff truce which has significantly improved risk sentiment and boosted the Chinese yuan, softer US inflation data leading to delayed Fed rate cut expectations, and PBOC interventions to moderate yuan appreciation. Equities gains in the US and oil price increases reflect improved growth prospects, while bond yield spreads and currency movements highlight the interplay between monetary policy expectations and trade developments. The cautious Fed outlook and geopolitical easing further underpin the current market environment.",
            "implications_for_trading": "The improved risk sentiment and narrowing US-China yield spreads support a stronger yuan, putting downward pressure on USD/CNH despite modest US yield increases. The PBOC's active management to curb rapid yuan gains introduces some volatility and risk for traders. USD/JPY and other major FX pairs may see dollar strength supported by delayed Fed cuts, but the tariff truce and softer inflation data temper this effect. Traders should watch for upcoming US economic data and trade negotiations as key catalysts for further USD/CNH moves, with opportunities to capitalize on yuan appreciation balanced against intervention risks.",
            "conclusion": "The market tone is cautiously optimistic with a slightly risk-on bias driven by the US-China tariff truce and softer US inflation, though PBOC interventions and the temporary nature of the trade deal warrant vigilance.

Bond yields in both the US and Germany rose modestly, with US yields increasing more sharply, maintaining a positive yield spread favoring the USD.",
            "key_market_drivers": "The primary market drivers include the cautious equity market performance, the sharp decline in gold prices, and rising US Treasury yields relative to German bunds. The modest increase in US yields versus German yields supports the USD, while softer commodity prices and mixed equity signals reflect uncertainty. The slight strengthening of the DXY (+0.06%) amid these factors highlights the influence of yield differentials and cautious risk sentiment. Additionally, easing US-China trade tensions and softer US inflation data are key fundamental drivers shaping market expectations and Fed policy outlook.",
            "implications_for_trading": "The slightly risk-off to neutral sentiment combined with rising US yields relative to Germany supports a modestly stronger USD, putting pressure on EUR/USD, which is reflected in its slight decline (-0.07%). The narrow US-Germany yield spreads suggest limited but persistent interest rate advantage for the USD. Traders should watch for technical resistance near 1.126 and support around 1.119 in EUR/USD. Potential trading opportunities include short EUR/USD positions if bearish momentum below support intensifies, while any further easing in trade tensions or softer US inflation could provide upside risks. Monitoring Fed and ECB policy signals will be crucial for directional cues.",

            "implications_for_trading": "The slightly risk-on environment and narrow US-Japan yield spreads suggest limited upward pressure on USD/JPY from interest rate differentials. Softer US inflation and cautious Fed outlook reduce the USD's safe-haven appeal, contributing to USD weakness against the JPY. The observed decline in USD/JPY (-0.53%) aligns with these dynamics. Traders should anticipate range-bound trading with a downward bias for USD/JPY, sensitive to upcoming US economic data and Fed communications. Potential trading opportunities lie in tactical short USD/JPY positions on risk-on shifts, but risks remain from geopolitical uncertainties and possible volatility spikes.",

The near parity in US-UK yield spreads limits strong carry-driven moves, making technical levels and upcoming economic data critical for direction. Traders should watch US inflation and Fed speeches for USD momentum shifts, and UK GDP and labor data for sterling strength.

            "conclusion": "Market tone is cautiously optimistic with a slightly risk-on bias driven by trade optimism and softer US inflation, supporting yuan strength but tempered by Chinese policy interventions. USD/CNH traders should expect limited yuan appreciation with potential volatility around US economic data and PBOC signals, warranting a balanced and vigilant trading approach.",

Commodity prices are declining, with gold down 2.06% and Brent oil down 1.23%, which typically signals reduced safe-haven demand but also some caution. The VIX volatility index is up 2.25%, indicating slightly elevated market nervousness. Bond yields in both the US and Germany are rising, with US 2Y and 10Y yields up nearly 1%, and German yields also increasing but to a lesser extent. The US-Germany yield spreads remain very tight (around 2 basis points), suggesting limited divergence in monetary policy expectations between the US and Eurozone. Overall, the market exhibits a slightly risk-on sentiment but with guarded caution due to tariff and inflation uncertainties.",
            "key_market_drivers": "The primary market drivers are the easing US-China trade tensions which have improved risk appetite and supported modest equity gains, alongside a cautious Federal Reserve stance that keeps bond yields elevated but stable. The decline in gold and oil prices reflects reduced safe-haven demand and some risk-off undercurrents. Technical factors are also influential, especially for EUR/USD, where bearish momentum below key moving averages is reinforcing downward pressure. The tight US-Germany yield spreads limit the impact of interest rate differentials on currency moves, making trade tensions and Fed communications the dominant drivers.",
            "implications_for_trading": "The slightly risk-on environment combined with a cautious Fed stance and tariff-related inflation risks suggests limited upside for EUR/USD in the near term. The tight US-Germany yield spreads mean that interest rate differentials are not strongly favoring either currency, so technical factors and risk sentiment will likely dominate EUR/USD movements. The USD's modest strength, supported by safe-haven demand and Fed caution, keeps EUR/USD under pressure, especially as it struggles below key moving averages. Traders should watch for US retail sales data and Fed Chair Powell's remarks as potential catalysts. Potential trading opportunities include short EUR/USD positions on breaks below key support levels, while risks include sudden shifts in trade negotiations or Fed policy that could trigger reversals.",
            "conclusion": "The market tone is cautiously optimistic with a slightly risk-on bias but tempered by tariff and inflation uncertainties, resulting in bearish technical momentum for EUR/USD. Traders should prepare for range-bound to downward pressure on EUR/USD, closely monitoring US economic data and Fed communications for directional clarity.",

Commodity prices, with gold down sharply (-2.06%) and Brent oil down (-1.23%), reflect reduced safe-haven demand and some risk-off pressures. The VIX rising (+2.25%) signals increased market volatility and caution. US Treasury yields have increased notably (2Y +0.95%, 10Y +1.00%), with Japanese yields rising modestly, resulting in a stable but narrow US-Japan yield spread (~3 bps), indicating steady but cautious monetary policy expectations. Overall, the market exhibits a slightly risk-on stance tempered by caution and volatility.",
            "key_market_drivers": "Primary drivers include US equity strength supporting risk appetite, tempered by European and emerging market caution. Rising US yields reflect ongoing Fed patience but sustained inflation concerns. Declining gold and oil prices reduce safe-haven appeal and commodity-driven inflation fears. The narrow US-Japan yield spread limits USD/JPY directional bias, while technical levels around 146.7 in USD/JPY and trade negotiations remain critical. Fed Chair Powell's upcoming remarks and US inflation data are key catalysts influencing market positioning.",
            "implications_for_trading": "The slightly risk-on environment with modestly higher US yields supports USD strength, but the narrow US-Japan yield spread and persistent tariff uncertainties cap USD/JPY upside, fostering range-bound trading near technical support at 146.7. Reduced safe-haven demand pressures the yen, but potential yen appreciation remains if dollar softness persists amid trade surplus dynamics. Traders should watch for volatility spikes around Fed commentary and trade developments, with opportunities in short-term USD/JPY range plays and caution against sharp directional bets until clearer policy signals emerge.",
            "conclusion": "The market tone is cautiously optimistic with mixed signals from equities, yields, and commodities, resulting in range-bound but volatile USD/JPY trading.

Commodity prices, notably gold and Brent oil, have declined significantly, which typically signals reduced safe-haven demand and a tilt towards risk appetite, but the rise in VIX volatility index (+2.25%) indicates underlying market nervousness. Bond yields in both the US and UK have increased similarly, with near-zero yield spreads between US and UK 2- and 10-year bonds, reflecting closely aligned monetary policy expectations and limited interest rate differential impact on currency flows.",
            "key_market_drivers": "The primary market drivers are the cautious Federal Reserve stance amid tariff-related inflation uncertainty, easing US-China trade tensions improving risk appetite, and softer US inflation data reducing immediate Fed tightening concerns. US Treasury yields and technical levels in GBP/USD are also critical, with the USD's mixed momentum influenced by these macro factors and FX-specific developments such as US-Korea talks. Equity gains in the US support risk-on sentiment, but European weakness and rising volatility suggest caution. Declining commodity prices reduce inflation concerns but also reflect subdued global growth expectations.",
            "implications_for_trading": "The near parity in US-UK yield spreads limits strong directional bias from interest rate differentials for GBP/USD, while the cautious Fed stance and easing trade tensions support a slightly risk-on environment that could favor GBP gains if key technical supports hold. However, the mixed USD momentum and rising volatility imply potential range-bound trading with downside risks if GBP/USD breaches critical moving averages near 1.3256. Traders should watch US economic data and Fed communications closely, as these will influence USD strength and thus GBP/USD direction. The slight increase in US yields relative to UK yields may support USD resilience, limiting GBP upside in the near term.",
            "conclusion": "The market tone is cautiously optimistic with a slightly risk-on bias driven by easing trade tensions and softer inflation data, but rising volatility and mixed equity performance warrant caution. For GBP/USD traders, maintaining a close watch on technical support levels and upcoming US data is essential, as the pair is likely to trade in a range with limited upside unless key resistance levels are decisively broken.",

Commodity prices, notably gold and Brent oil, have declined significantly, which typically signals reduced safe-haven demand and a tilt towards risk-taking. However, the rise in VIX suggests some underlying market caution or volatility. Bond yields in both the US and China have increased, with US yields rising slightly more, maintaining a positive yield spread favoring the dollar. This reflects expectations of relatively tighter US monetary policy compared to China, supporting a cautious but optimistic risk environment.",
            "key_market_drivers": "The primary drivers shaping the current market environment include the US-China 90-day tariff truce, which has boosted risk sentiment and yuan strength, and softer US inflation data that have delayed Fed rate cuts, weakening the dollar near term. Chinese state-owned banks' interventions to curb excessive yuan appreciation and the PBOC's controlled midpoint fixing also play a critical role in managing currency volatility. Additionally, rising US and Chinese bond yields and the modestly positive US equity performance underpin the cautious optimism. Commodity price declines and the slight increase in volatility (VIX) add nuance, reflecting some residual risk concerns.",
            "implications_for_trading": "The slightly risk-on sentiment combined with a positive US-China trade development supports yuan appreciation, but Chinese policy interventions cap rapid gains, leading to limited downside for USD/CNH. The maintained positive yield spread between US and China bonds favors the dollar, preventing sharp yuan strength. For USD/CNH traders, this suggests a trading range with potential for gradual yuan appreciation if trade optimism persists, but with risks of volatility spikes due to geopolitical or policy shifts. Monitoring US inflation data and PBOC signals will be crucial, as further easing of Fed tightening expectations could weaken the dollar further against the yuan, while renewed trade tensions or policy tightening could reverse gains.",
            "conclusion": "The market tone is cautiously optimistic with a slight risk-on bias driven by trade optimism and softer US inflation, but tempered by Chinese policy interventions and structural concerns. USD/CNH traders should prepare for controlled yuan appreciation within a range, remaining vigilant for policy and geopolitical developments that could disrupt the current balance.",

            "implications_for_trading": "The slightly risk-on sentiment combined with widening US-Germany yield spreads supports a firmer USD, putting downward pressure on EUR/USD, consistent with the technical bearish momentum below key moving averages. Traders should be cautious of potential further downside in EUR/USD if support levels around 1.1193–1.1213 break, especially ahead of key US data releases and Fed Chair Powell's remarks. The cautious Fed stance and tariff uncertainties may limit USD downside, suggesting range-bound trading with a bias toward USD strength.
