"The recent news highlights several key factors influencing the EUR/USD pair. The holiday season is contributing to thin market liquidity, which can lead to increased volatility. This suggests a cautious approach due to potential price swings. The US dollar's strength, driven by rising bond yields and a strong economic outlook, exerts downward pressure on the EUR/USD. However, the Federal Reserve's dovish outlook and potential rate cuts in 2025 could weaken the dollar, which might benefit the euro. Geopolitical tensions, particularly President Trump's tariff threats towards the EU, add uncertainty and potential volatility to the market. Traders should be vigilant of economic data releases and central bank communications.
The technical analysis indicates that the EUR/USD is currently consolidating around the 1.0430-1.0435 level, which is within a key resistance zone identified in previous analyses. The 5-minute chart shows a lack of strong trend, with moving averages flat and intertwined, and momentum indicators like RSI and MACD showing neutral momentum. The price is above the pivot point, which is a bullish sign, but the consolidation suggests indecision. Key levels to watch are 1.0445 for a bullish breakout and 1.0430 for a bearish move.
Upcoming economic events include the US Durable Goods Orders on December 24th, expected to decline, which could indicate a slowdown in manufacturing activity and potentially impact the USD negatively. However, the holiday period may lead to lower trading volumes and reduced volatility, as there is a substantial time gap until the next significant events in January. Traders should be cautious about potential market movements around the Durable Goods Orders release.Given the current market conditions, the best strategy is to wait for a clearer signal before entering a trade. The EUR/USD is consolidating within a tight range, and there is no clear directional bias at the moment. The thin holiday liquidity and mixed signals from recent news and technical analysis suggest that any trade executed now would carry higher risk. A decisive breakout above 1.0445 or below 1.0430, confirmed by volume and momentum indicators, would provide a clearer trading opportunity.

The technical analysis of the 5-minute chart shows the price consolidating around the 1.043 level, which aligns with the hourly analysis's identified resistance. The short-term trend is not strongly defined, with weak momentum indicators. This indicates a lack of clear direction. A short entry could be considered if the price fails to break above 1.044 and shows signs of rejection. A long entry is not advisable at this time due to the medium-term bearish trend. The key is to wait for a clear signal of rejection at 1.044 or a strong break above it.
The economic events show a mixed picture. Past events include positive US data (Initial Jobless Claims, Trade Balance, Factory Orders) supporting the USD, and a stronger German Trade Balance supporting the EUR.

However, the lack of strong momentum and the mixed economic data make a high-confidence trade difficult. Therefore, the best approach is to wait for a clear signal. A short trade could be considered if the price rejects 1.044, with a tight stop-loss at 1.0445 and a take profit at 1.042. If the price breaks above 1.044 with strong bullish momentum, the strategy should be re-evaluated.
