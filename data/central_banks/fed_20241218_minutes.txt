The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) held a meeting on December 17-18, 2024, where they reviewed recent developments in financial markets, the economic situation, and monetary policy. Here are the key points from the minutes:

1. **Financial Market Developments**:
   - Treasury yields increased slightly since early November, primarily due to rising real yields.
   - Liquidity in Treasury markets showed some deterioration post-U.S. elections but remained stable overall.
   - Market expectations indicated a nearly certain 25 basis point cut in the federal funds rate at this meeting, with a slower pace of cuts anticipated in 2025.
   - The trade-weighted U.S. dollar index rose, influenced by diverging interest rate expectations between the U.S. and other advanced economies.

2. **Economic Situation**:
   - Real GDP continued to grow solidly, with labor market conditions easing slightly but the unemployment rate remaining low at 4.2%.
   - Inflation, as measured by the Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, was reported at 2.3% in October, down from 3.0% a year prior, indicating some disinflationary progress.
   - Core inflation remained elevated, and participants expressed concerns about the persistence of inflationary pressures.

3. **Monetary Policy Decisions**:
   - The FOMC unanimously voted to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4.25% to 4.50%.
   - Participants noted that while inflation had made progress, it remained somewhat elevated, and the economic outlook was uncertain.
   - The Committee agreed to continue reducing its holdings of Treasury and agency securities and to adjust the Overnight Reverse Repurchase Agreement (ON RRP) rate to align with the bottom of the target range for the federal funds rate.

4. **Outlook and Risks**:
   - The staff projected solid economic conditions ahead, with GDP growth slightly slower than previous forecasts and inflation expected to remain around 2% in the longer term.
   - Risks to the inflation outlook were seen as tilted to the upside, with potential impacts from trade and immigration policy changes.
   - Participants emphasized the need for a careful approach to future monetary policy adjustments, given the current economic uncertainties.

5. **Next Steps**:
   - The Committee plans to continue monitoring incoming data and the evolving economic outlook, with a focus on labor market conditions and inflation pressures.
   - The next FOMC meeting is scheduled for January 28-29, 2025.

Overall, the FOMC's discussions reflected a cautious approach to monetary policy, balancing the need to support economic growth while addressing persistent inflation concerns.
