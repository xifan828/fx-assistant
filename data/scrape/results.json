The decision reflects growing confidence that inflation is on track to return sustainably to the 2% target. Both headline and core inflation have continued to ease, with services inflation also cooling. Wage growth is moderating, and firms are absorbing some of the cost pressure. However, risks to the Euro Area outlook remain, especially due to rising global trade tensions, which are hurting confidence and tightening financial conditions. The ECB acknowledged that growth prospects have weakened and emphasized a data-dependent approach going forward. It made no commitment to further cuts, underlining that future decisions will depend on economic data, inflation dynamics, and the strength of monetary transmission.source:European Central Bank",

At the same time, a majority of officials highlighted the possibility that inflationary pressures from various sources could prove more persistent than previously anticipated. Nearly all participants viewed inflation risks as tilted to the upside, while risks to employment were seen as skewed to the downside. The Fed kept the federal funds rate unchanged at 4.25%-4.5% during its March 2025 meeting, extending the pause in its rate-cut cycle that began in January, in line with expectations. The Fed also raised their expectations for inflation for 2025 and 2026 and downgraded their 2025 growth forecasts, while still anticipating reducing interest rates by around 50 bps this year, the same as in the December projection.source:Federal Reserve",

Meanwhile, new orders declined at a slower pace (47.2 vs. 45.2), though new export orders fell more steeply amid ongoing tariff-related disruptions. Meanwhile, the rate of job losses moderated slightly (46.5 vs. 44.7). The ISM survey also revealed U.S. manufacturers were grappling with rising costs and margin pressure, while ongoing trade uncertainty was disrupting supply chains, causing shipping delays, complex duties, and frequent changes in cost structures. At the same time, they said customer demand was becoming more volatile, with some clients delaying orders or pushing tariff costs back onto manufacturers.source:Institute for Supply Management",

The unanimous decision came amid rising concerns that U.S. President Trump's tariff measures could dampen both U.S. and global economic growth. Tokyo is currently negotiating a trade deal with Washington, which may influence future policy moves. The board signaled that it would raise rates if economic and price forecasts materialize. In its quarterly outlook, the BoJ lowered its FY 2025 GDP growth forecast to 0.5% from 1.0% projected in January, citing trade risks and policy uncertainty. The 2026 growth outlook was also reduced to 0.7% from 1.0%. The BoJ also trimmed its core inflation forecast for FY 2025 to 2.2% from 2.7% and expects it to ease further to 1.7% in FY 2026 before ticking up to 1.9% in FY 2027.

The inflation figures arrive ahead of the BOJ’s policy meeting next week, where the central bank is expected to keep its benchmark rate unchanged at 0.5% and lower its growth forecasts. Core inflation has remained at or above the BOJ’s 2% target for nearly three years, driven by persistently high food prices and rising wages.

Transport also contributed to the slowdown (1.2% vs 1.8%), largely due to a 5.3% fall in motor fuel prices.

Still, the latest drop was significantly milder than February’s 0.7% fall, supported by a smaller decline in food prices as pork prices accelerated and fresh fruit costs rebounded. Meanwhile, non-food prices rose by 0.2%, reversing a slight dip of 0.1% in February, driven by increases in housing (0.1% vs 0.1%), healthcare (0.1% vs 0.2%), and education (0.8% vs -0.5%), despite a continued decline in transport costs (-2.6% vs -2.5%). Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and fuel prices, rose 0.5% in March, rebounding from a 0.1% decrease in February.

It marked the softest quarterly expansion since Q2 of 2024 while representing the 11th consecutive quarter of advance. Since February, U.S. President Donald Trump has sharply raised tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%, prompting Beijing to retaliate with duties on American imports. China's policymakers have emphasized that the nation has ample tools to support its economic output, with Premier Li Qiang recently pledging further stimulus. Boosting consumption remains a top priority this year as the government seeks to offset the impact of surging U.S. duties. The Politburo is expected to meet later in April to outline upcoming policy plans. In March, China announced increased fiscal spending, including a higher budget deficit, and officials have signaled more fiscal and monetary support ahead, following a wave of easing measures late last year.source:National Bureau of Statistics of China",

The sharp increase was largely driven by a 12.4% year-on-year surge in exports, the fastest rise since last October, surpassing market forecasts of a 4.4% gain, as factories rushed to ship goods ahead of U.S. President Trump's upcoming tariffs. Meanwhile, imports fell by 4.3%, compared to market expectations of a 2% drop and following an 8.4% slump in the January–February period, due to weak domestic demand. The trade surplus with the US stood at USD 27.58 billion in March. For the first quarter of the year, the country posted a USD 273 billion surplus, with exports rising 5.8% while imports falling 7.0%. During the period, the trade surplus with the US reached USD 76.65 billion, as exports advanced 4.5% while imports declined 1.4%.source:General Administration of Customs",

The decision reflects growing confidence that inflation is on track to return sustainably to the 2% target. Both headline and core inflation have continued to ease, with services inflation also cooling. Wage growth is moderating, and firms are absorbing some of the cost pressure. However, risks to the Euro Area outlook remain, especially due to rising global trade tensions, which are hurting confidence and tightening financial conditions. The ECB acknowledged that growth prospects have weakened and emphasized a data-dependent approach going forward. It made no commitment to further cuts, underlining that future decisions will depend on economic data, inflation dynamics, and the strength of monetary transmission.source:European Central Bank",

At the same time, a majority of officials highlighted the possibility that inflationary pressures from various sources could prove more persistent than previously anticipated. Nearly all participants viewed inflation risks as tilted to the upside, while risks to employment were seen as skewed to the downside. The Fed kept the federal funds rate unchanged at 4.25%-4.5% during its March 2025 meeting, extending the pause in its rate-cut cycle that began in January, in line with expectations. The Fed also raised their expectations for inflation for 2025 and 2026 and downgraded their 2025 growth forecasts, while still anticipating reducing interest rates by around 50 bps this year, the same as in the December projection.source:Federal Reserve",

Meanwhile, new orders declined at a slower pace (47.2 vs. 45.2), though new export orders fell more steeply amid ongoing tariff-related disruptions. Meanwhile, the rate of job losses moderated slightly (46.5 vs. 44.7). The ISM survey also revealed U.S. manufacturers were grappling with rising costs and margin pressure, while ongoing trade uncertainty was disrupting supply chains, causing shipping delays, complex duties, and frequent changes in cost structures. At the same time, they said customer demand was becoming more volatile, with some clients delaying orders or pushing tariff costs back onto manufacturers.source:Institute for Supply Management",

On the other hand, sales fell for fuel oil, transport, and government goods and services. Meanwhile, imports were little changed close to record levels at $401.1 billion, after surging last month driven by anticipation of upcoming tariffs.

Tokyo is currently negotiating a trade deal with Washington, which may influence future policy moves. The board signaled that it would raise rates if economic and price forecasts materialize. In its quarterly outlook, the BoJ lowered its FY 2025 GDP growth forecast to 0.5% from 1.0% projected in January, citing trade risks and policy uncertainty. The 2026 growth outlook was also reduced to 0.7% from 1.0%. The BoJ also trimmed its core inflation forecast for FY 2025 to 2.2% from 2.7% and expects it to ease further to 1.7% in FY 2026 before ticking up to 1.9% in FY 2027.

The data supports the Bank of Japan’s approach of gradual interest rate hikes, though rising economic risks, particularly from sweeping U.S. tariffs, cast a shadow over the outlook. The inflation figures arrive ahead of the BOJ’s policy meeting next week, where the central bank is expected to keep its benchmark rate unchanged at 0.5% and lower its growth forecasts. Core inflation has remained at or above the BOJ’s 2% target for nearly three years, driven by persistently high food prices and rising wages. While further rate hikes are anticipated later this year, the U.S. trade measures add uncertainty to Japan’s export-reliant economy.source:Statistics Bureau of Japan",

Also, household consumption increased 0.1%, revised up from the initial estimate of no growth, mostly due to spending on restaurants and hotels, and housing.

Both rates are at record lows following reductions in October and July of last year. The latest decision came after GDP grew more than expected, at 5.4% year-on-year in Q1 of 2025, remaining the highest growth in one and a half years, amid Beijing's ongoing stimulus efforts.

Since February, U.S. President Donald Trump has sharply raised tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%, prompting Beijing to retaliate with duties on American imports. China's policymakers have emphasized that the nation has ample tools to support its economic output, with Premier Li Qiang recently pledging further stimulus. Boosting consumption remains a top priority this year as the government seeks to offset the impact of surging U.S. duties.

This was the second straight month of contraction due to continued weakness in domestic demand ahead of massive U.S. tariff hikes. For the first three months of the year, purchases dipped 7.0% to USD 580.7 billion. During the period, import values dropped for refined oil (-20.2%), natural gas (-16.0%), rare earth (-31.0%), and steel (-10.5%). In contrast, they rose for automatic data equipment (85.0%), high-tech products (9.2%), and integrated circuits (3.2%). Purchase values also grew for unwrought copper & copper material (2.5%) and electrical products (4.2%). Imports shrank from the US (-1.4%), the EU (-6.3%), South Korea (-0.7%), Japan (-4.1%), the UK (-12.1%), India (-25.1%), and Russia (-6.7%) but rose from ASEAN countries (2.8%), Hong Kong (0.7%), and Taiwan (17.8%). In 2024, they rose 1.1% to USD 2.59 trillion.source:General Administration of Customs",

The decision reflects growing confidence that inflation is on track to return sustainably to the 2% target. Both headline and core inflation have continued to ease, with services inflation also cooling. Wage growth is moderating, and firms are absorbing some of the cost pressure. However, risks to the Euro Area outlook remain, especially due to rising global trade tensions, which are hurting confidence and tightening financial conditions. The ECB acknowledged that growth prospects have weakened and emphasized a data-dependent approach going forward. It made no commitment to further cuts, underlining that future decisions will depend on economic data, inflation dynamics, and the strength of monetary transmission.source:European Central Bank",

The data provided some relief for European Central Bank policymakers as they continue efforts to curb inflation while supporting sluggish economic growth. The ECB has recently indicated plans to continue easing monetary policy, with money markets pricing in at least two interest rate cuts by the end of December. Meanwhile, a mid-February survey from the ECB indicated that Eurozone firms expect wage growth to slow to 3.6% in 2025 from 4.3% in 2024, before further declining to 2.7% in 2026. For the full year 2024, negotiated wage growth edged up to 4.48% from 4.44% in 2023, marking the highest annual increase since 1993.source:European Central Bank",

Policymakers noted that uncertainty about the economic outlook has increased further and that the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen. During the regular press conference, Fed Chair Powell said that it's too early to determine whether inflation or unemployment will emerge as the greater concern, and the Fed does not need to rush into adjusting interest rates. The central bank can afford to be patient, monitoring incoming data and adopting a wait-and-see approach. The Fed also said that that although swings in net exports have affected the data, recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace.source:Federal Reserve",

The reading signaled a second consecutive month of contraction in the manufacturing sector as output shrank more sharply (44.0 vs. 48.3) and prices rose further (69.8 vs. 69.4). Meanwhile, new orders declined at a slower pace (47.2 vs. 45.2), though new export orders fell more steeply amid ongoing tariff-related disruptions. Meanwhile, the rate of job losses moderated slightly (46.5 vs. 44.7). The ISM survey also revealed U.S. manufacturers were grappling with rising costs and margin pressure, while ongoing trade uncertainty was disrupting supply chains, causing shipping delays, complex duties, and frequent changes in cost structures. At the same time, they said customer demand was becoming more volatile, with some clients delaying orders or pushing tariff costs back onto manufacturers.source:Institute for Supply Management",

Tokyo is currently negotiating a trade deal with Washington, which may influence future policy moves. The board signaled that it would raise rates if economic and price forecasts materialize. In its quarterly outlook, the BoJ lowered its FY 2025 GDP growth forecast to 0.5% from 1.0% projected in January, citing trade risks and policy uncertainty. The 2026 growth outlook was also reduced to 0.7% from 1.0%. The BoJ also trimmed its core inflation forecast for FY 2025 to 2.2% from 2.7% and expects it to ease further to 1.7% in FY 2026 before ticking up to 1.9% in FY 2027.

Core inflation has remained at or above the BOJ’s 2% target for nearly three years, driven by persistently high food prices and rising wages.

This is the first policy meeting since those tariffs were announced, and markets will closely watch for any shifts in the bank’s tone or economic outlook. Inflation eased more than expected in March, falling to 2.6% from 2.8%, reinforcing the case for a rate cut. Attention will also focus on the vote split within the Monetary Policy Committee and whether the bank maintains its \"gradual and careful\" approach to easing. Markets have nearly fully priced in four total cuts by year-end. The BoE plans to delay its announcement by two minutes to 1102 GMT, when it will release the rate decision, updated forecasts, and meeting minutes.source:Bank of England",

Still, the latest drop was significantly milder than February’s 0.7% fall, supported by a smaller decline in food prices as pork prices accelerated and fresh fruit costs rebounded. Meanwhile, non-food prices rose by 0.2%, reversing a slight dip of 0.1% in February, driven by increases in housing (0.1% vs 0.1%), healthcare (0.1% vs 0.2%), and education (0.8% vs -0.5%), despite a continued decline in transport costs (-2.6% vs -2.5%). Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and fuel prices, rose 0.5% in March, rebounding from a 0.1% decrease in February. On a monthly basis, the CPI declined by 0.4%, a steeper fall than a 0.2% drop in February, marking the second straight month of contraction.source:National Bureau of Statistics of China",

It marked the softest quarterly expansion since Q2 of 2024 while representing the 11th consecutive quarter of advance. Since February, U.S. President Donald Trump has sharply raised tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%, prompting Beijing to retaliate with duties on American imports. China's policymakers have emphasized that the nation has ample tools to support its economic output, with Premier Li Qiang recently pledging further stimulus. Boosting consumption remains a top priority this year as the government seeks to offset the impact of surging U.S. duties. The Politburo is expected to meet later in April to outline upcoming policy plans. In March, China announced increased fiscal spending, including a higher budget deficit, and officials have signaled more fiscal and monetary support ahead, following a wave of easing measures late last year.source:National Bureau of Statistics of China",

The decision reflects growing confidence that inflation is on track to return sustainably to the 2% target. Both headline and core inflation have continued to ease, with services inflation also cooling. Wage growth is moderating, and firms are absorbing some of the cost pressure. However, risks to the Euro Area outlook remain, especially due to rising global trade tensions, which are hurting confidence and tightening financial conditions. The ECB acknowledged that growth prospects have weakened and emphasized a data-dependent approach going forward. It made no commitment to further cuts, underlining that future decisions will depend on economic data, inflation dynamics, and the strength of monetary transmission.source:European Central Bank",

Policymakers noted that uncertainty about the economic outlook has increased further and that the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen. During the regular press conference, Fed Chair Powell said that it's too early to determine whether inflation or unemployment will emerge as the greater concern, and the Fed does not need to rush into adjusting interest rates. The central bank can afford to be patient, monitoring incoming data and adopting a wait-and-see approach. The Fed also said that that although swings in net exports have affected the data, recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace.source:Federal Reserve",

Meanwhile, new orders declined at a slower pace (47.2 vs. 45.2), though new export orders fell more steeply amid ongoing tariff-related disruptions. Meanwhile, the rate of job losses moderated slightly (46.5 vs. 44.7). The ISM survey also revealed U.S. manufacturers were grappling with rising costs and margin pressure, while ongoing trade uncertainty was disrupting supply chains, causing shipping delays, complex duties, and frequent changes in cost structures. At the same time, they said customer demand was becoming more volatile, with some clients delaying orders or pushing tariff costs back onto manufacturers.source:Institute for Supply Management",

The unanimous decision came amid rising concerns that U.S. President Trump's tariff measures could dampen both U.S. and global economic growth. Tokyo is currently negotiating a trade deal with Washington, which may influence future policy moves. The board signaled that it would raise rates if economic and price forecasts materialize. In its quarterly outlook, the BoJ lowered its FY 2025 GDP growth forecast to 0.5% from 1.0% projected in January, citing trade risks and policy uncertainty. The 2026 growth outlook was also reduced to 0.7% from 1.0%. The BoJ also trimmed its core inflation forecast for FY 2025 to 2.2% from 2.7% and expects it to ease further to 1.7% in FY 2026 before ticking up to 1.9% in FY 2027.

The inflation figures arrive ahead of the BOJ’s policy meeting next week, where the central bank is expected to keep its benchmark rate unchanged at 0.5% and lower its growth forecasts. Core inflation has remained at or above the BOJ’s 2% target for nearly three years, driven by persistently high food prices and rising wages.

The decision reflects continued disinflation progress as external shocks eased and tight policy helped anchor inflation expectations. UK GDP growth has slowed since mid-2024, and the labour market is loosening. CPI inflation fell to 2.6% in March, though a temporary rise to 3.5% is expected in Q3 due to earlier energy price spikes. Inflation is forecast to ease again thereafter. Pay growth remains high but is expected to slow. Global uncertainty has risen due to new US tariffs, weakening global growth and lowering market interest rate expectations. The MPC remains committed to returning inflation to 2% sustainably. Future policy will depend on evolving risks and inflation dynamics. A cautious, data-driven approach to reducing policy restraint remains appropriate.source:Bank of England",

Still, the latest drop was significantly milder than February’s 0.7% fall, supported by a smaller decline in food prices as pork prices accelerated and fresh fruit costs rebounded. Meanwhile, non-food prices rose by 0.2%, reversing a slight dip of 0.1% in February, driven by increases in housing (0.1% vs 0.1%), healthcare (0.1% vs 0.2%), and education (0.8% vs -0.5%), despite a continued decline in transport costs (-2.6% vs -2.5%). Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and fuel prices, rose 0.5% in March, rebounding from a 0.1% decrease in February.

It marked the softest quarterly expansion since Q2 of 2024 while representing the 11th consecutive quarter of advance. Since February, U.S. President Donald Trump has sharply raised tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%, prompting Beijing to retaliate with duties on American imports. China's policymakers have emphasized that the nation has ample tools to support its economic output, with Premier Li Qiang recently pledging further stimulus. Boosting consumption remains a top priority this year as the government seeks to offset the impact of surging U.S. duties. The Politburo is expected to meet later in April to outline upcoming policy plans. In March, China announced increased fiscal spending, including a higher budget deficit, and officials have signaled more fiscal and monetary support ahead, following a wave of easing measures late last year.source:National Bureau of Statistics of China",

The sharp increase was largely driven by a 12.4% year-on-year surge in exports, the fastest rise since last October, surpassing market forecasts of a 4.4% gain, as factories rushed to ship goods ahead of U.S. President Trump's upcoming tariffs. Meanwhile, imports fell by 4.3%, compared to market expectations of a 2% drop and following an 8.4% slump in the January–February period, due to weak domestic demand. The trade surplus with the US stood at USD 27.58 billion in March. For the first quarter of the year, the country posted a USD 273 billion surplus, with exports rising 5.8% while imports falling 7.0%. During the period, the trade surplus with the US reached USD 76.65 billion, as exports advanced 4.5% while imports declined 1.4%.source:General Administration of Customs",
