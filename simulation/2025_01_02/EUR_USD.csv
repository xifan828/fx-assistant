The absence of immediate economic events suggests that technical factors might dominate short-term movements.Given the strong technical bearish signals and the absence of immediate economic events, a short position is advised. The entry point is set at 1.0350, which is a key support level. A break below this level with strong momentum would confirm the downtrend continuation. The take profit is set at 1.0320, slightly above the S1 pivot point, to capture potential profits before hitting strong support. The stop loss is set at 1.0375, above the immediate resistance and pivot point, to protect against unexpected reversals.

The lack of events today means that current price movements are likely driven by technical factors and existing market sentiment rather than new economic data.Given the strong bearish sentiment from recent news and the longer-term bearish outlook, combined with the short-term bullish reversal in the technical analysis, the strategy is to wait for further confirmation. The R2 pivot point at 1.03613 is a critical level. If the price breaks above with strong bullish momentum, it could indicate a continuation of the short-term bullish trend.
