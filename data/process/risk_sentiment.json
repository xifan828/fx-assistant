            "risk_sentiment_analysis": "Global equity indices are strongly positive, with the S&P 500 up 1.47%, Nasdaq +1.60%, STOXX50 +2.39%, and MSCI Emerging Markets +1.92%, indicating a clear risk-on environment. The VIX index has dropped by 7.8%, further confirming reduced market volatility and increased risk appetite. Gold prices have risen modestly (+0.66%), which can sometimes signal cautious optimism or safe-haven demand, but the decline in Brent oil (-1.35%) suggests some pressure on commodity-driven inflation concerns. Bond yields in both the US and Germany have increased, with US 2Y and 10Y yields rising by 3.44% and 2.21% respectively, and German yields also up significantly, reflecting expectations of tighter monetary policy. The narrow US-Germany yield spreads (around 2 basis points) imply limited divergence in monetary policy outlooks between the two regions, supporting balanced currency flows.",
            "key_market_drivers": "The primary market drivers are the strong US labor market data boosting Treasury yields and underpinning USD fundamentals, alongside easing US-China trade tensions that have improved global risk appetite and supported equity markets. Inflation concerns in Europe, particularly rising food prices, are reinforcing ECB hawkishness, supporting the euro. Technical momentum in EUR/USD, breaking above key moving averages, also plays a significant role. Mixed US economic data and rising US oil rig counts add complexity but do not overshadow the dominant themes of labor strength and risk-on sentiment.",
            "implications_for_trading": "The risk-on environment and narrowing US-Germany yield spreads suggest a balanced but slightly bullish outlook for EUR/USD, supported by improved risk sentiment and ECB hawkishness. While strong US labor data and rising yields typically support USD strength, the easing of trade tensions and positive equity performance are limiting USD gains, allowing EUR/USD to edge higher. Traders should watch for potential resistance near 1.1400 and support around 1.1270â€“1.1300, with technical breakouts indicating further upside potential. The USD/JPY pair may see less directional pressure given the balanced risk sentiment and yield differentials, but geopolitical uncertainties could add volatility.",
            "conclusion": "The market tone is cautiously optimistic with a clear risk-on bias supported by strong US labor data and easing trade tensions, creating a nuanced environment for EUR/USD. Traders should focus on key technical levels and monitor trade negotiations and Fed policy signals for directional clarity, as EUR/USD is poised for modest gains but remains sensitive to shifts in risk sentiment and yield spreads.",

        "USD/JPY": {
            "risk_sentiment_analysis": "Global equity indices including the S&P 500 (+1.47%), Nasdaq (+1.60%), STOXX50 (+2.39%), and MSCI Emerging Markets (+1.92%) are all showing strong gains, indicating a clear risk-on environment. The VIX index has dropped significantly (-7.80%), reinforcing reduced market volatility and increased risk appetite. Gold prices have risen modestly (+0.66%), which may reflect some residual safe-haven demand or inflation concerns, but Brent oil prices have declined (-1.35%), suggesting mixed commodity signals. US Treasury yields have risen notably, with the 2-year yield up 3.44% and the 10-year yield up 2.21%, while Japanese yields have declined slightly, widening the US-Japan yield spreads. This yield divergence supports a stronger USD relative to JPY but is tempered by geopolitical uncertainties and cautious positioning.",
            "key_market_drivers": "The primary market drivers are the robust US labor market data fueling higher US Treasury yields and a stronger USD, which underpin the risk-on sentiment. Equities are rallying strongly, reflecting improved global risk appetite, likely supported by easing US-China trade tensions. The decline in the VIX further confirms reduced risk aversion. However, geopolitical factors, particularly Japan's opposition to US tariffs and its potential use of US Treasury holdings as leverage, introduce uncertainty that is restraining USD/JPY upside. Commodity prices are mixed, with gold rising slightly and oil falling, indicating nuanced risk sentiment. The yield spreads between US and Japan government bonds are key drivers influencing currency flows, especially USD/JPY.",
            "implications_for_trading": "The strong US Treasury yield increases relative to Japan's yields generally support USD strength against JPY, suggesting a fundamental bias for USD/JPY to move higher. However, the cautious risk sentiment due to geopolitical tensions and profit-taking near technical resistance levels around 145.00 is causing the pair to trade in a range-bound manner. Traders should be aware of potential volatility spikes around key US labor data releases and trade negotiation developments. The narrowing yield spread and easing safe-haven demand for JPY due to improved risk appetite reduce downward pressure on USD/JPY, but geopolitical risks and technical resistance create trading risks. Opportunities may arise from range-trading strategies or breakout plays contingent on US Nonfarm Payrolls and trade talks outcomes.",
            "conclusion": "The market tone is cautiously optimistic with a clear risk-on backdrop supported by strong US economic data and rising yields, yet USD/JPY remains range-bound due to geopolitical uncertainties and profit-taking. USD/JPY traders should prepare for potential volatility around upcoming US jobs data and trade negotiations, focusing on range-bound strategies near 144.50-145.00 while monitoring yield spreads and geopolitical developments closely.",

            "risk_sentiment_analysis": "Global equity indices are strongly positive, with the S&P 500 up 1.47%, Nasdaq up 1.60%, STOXX50 up 2.39%, and MSCI Emerging Markets up 1.92%, indicating a clear risk-on environment. The VIX has dropped significantly by 7.8%, reinforcing reduced market volatility and increased risk appetite. Gold prices have risen modestly by 0.66%, which can sometimes signal cautious risk sentiment, but the decline in Brent Oil by 1.35% suggests some selective profit-taking or supply concerns. US Treasury yields have risen notably (2Y up 3.44%, 10Y up 2.21%), outpacing UK yields, which have increased more modestly, resulting in near parity in US-UK yield spreads. This yield dynamic supports a stronger USD but also reflects expectations of continued US monetary tightening. Overall, the market exhibits a slightly risk-on sentiment with a cautious undertone due to mixed commodity signals and rising yields.",
            "key_market_drivers": "The primary market drivers are the strong performance in global equities and the significant rise in US Treasury yields, which bolster the USD. The mixed commodity signals, with gold up and oil down, add nuance but do not dominate the market narrative. The US labor market data supporting Treasury yields and USD strength is a key fundamental driver, while technical resistance levels in GBP/USD and cautious trade negotiations add complexity. The slight narrowing of US-UK yield spreads also influences GBP/USD dynamics, limiting GBP upside despite risk-on equity conditions.",
            "implications_for_trading": "The slightly risk-on environment with rising US yields supports a firm USD tone, putting downward pressure on GBP/USD, which is reflected in the pair trading below key moving averages and facing resistance near 1.3433. The near-zero US-UK yield spread limits GBP appreciation potential, while strong US labor data and Treasury yields favor USD strength. Traders should watch for potential GBP/USD rebounds if risk sentiment improves further or if US data disappoints, but current conditions favor range-bound or slightly bearish GBP/USD trading. USD/JPY and other major pairs may also reflect USD strength amid rising US yields, suggesting caution for GBP longs and opportunities for USD strength plays.",
            "conclusion": "The market is characterized by a cautiously risk-on tone driven by strong equities and rising US yields, supporting USD strength and limiting GBP/USD upside. GBP/USD traders should remain vigilant around key technical levels and US economic data, as the pair is likely to trade range-bound with a bearish bias unless USD momentum wanes or positive trade developments emerge.",

The VIX has dropped significantly by 7.8%, reinforcing reduced market volatility and increased risk appetite. Gold prices have risen modestly by 0.66%, which may reflect some safe-haven demand but are overshadowed by the strong equity gains. Brent oil prices have declined by 1.35%, which could be a mild drag on risk sentiment but not enough to offset the overall positive tone. US Treasury yields have risen notably, with the 2-year yield up 3.44% and the 10-year yield up 2.21%, while Chinese yields have slightly declined, widening the US-China yield spreads. This yield differential supports a stronger USD versus the CNH and reflects expectations of tighter US monetary policy relative to China.",
            "key_market_drivers": "The primary market drivers are the robust gains in global equities signaling risk-on sentiment, coupled with rising US Treasury yields that increase the attractiveness of USD assets. The PBOC's active intervention to stabilize the yuan and the narrowing of the trading band are critical in limiting sharp yuan depreciation despite economic headwinds. The modest rise in gold suggests some caution remains, but the dominant forces shaping the environment are equity strength and yield differentials. The USD/CNH pair is influenced by these yield spreads and the PBOC's policy stance, alongside ongoing trade tensions and economic data from China.",
            "implications_for_trading": "The risk-on environment and widening US-China yield spreads favor USD strength against CNH, as reflected in the recent 0.92% decline in USD/CNH. However, the PBOC's deliberate policy to stabilize the yuan and prevent sharp depreciation introduces a counterbalance, suggesting a controlled trading range in the near term. Traders should watch for volatility spikes around Chinese economic data and trade developments, which could create short-term trading opportunities. The yield advantage of US Treasuries supports USD strength, but cautious optimism around trade talks and PBOC intervention may limit sharp moves, implying a range-bound USD/CNH with potential gradual depreciation toward 7.35 medium term.",
            "conclusion": "The market exhibits a risk-on tone driven by strong equity gains and rising US yields, while the PBOC's active management tempers yuan depreciation risks. USD/CNH traders should prepare for a controlled trading range with potential gradual yuan weakening, closely monitoring policy signals and trade developments for directional cues.",
