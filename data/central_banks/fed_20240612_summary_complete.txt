## Federal Open Market Committee US

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) recently held a meeting on June 11-12, 2024, where they assessed the current economic landscape and monetary policy. Here are the key takeaways:

1. **Economic Expansion**: The U.S. economy is experiencing solid growth, characterized by strong job gains and a low unemployment rate. However, inflation remains elevated, with only modest progress towards the 2% target.

2. **Financial Conditions**: There has been a slight easing in financial conditions, attributed to rising equity prices and a general consensus that the federal funds rate has reached its peak. Treasury yields, particularly real yields, have declined, while inflation expectations remain stable.

3. **Monetary Policy Stance**: The FOMC decided to keep the federal funds rate target range at 5.25% to 5.50%. Members expressed caution regarding potential rate cuts, emphasizing the need for more data to ensure inflation is sustainably moving towards the 2% goal.

4. **Inflation Challenges**: Although inflation has eased, progress has been slower than anticipated. Ongoing price pressures in certain sectors and geopolitical risks could contribute to sustained inflation levels.

5. **Labor Market Dynamics**: The labor market shows signs of balance, with a slight uptick in the unemployment rate and a reduction in job openings. Nonetheless, wage growth continues to exceed levels that would support price stability.

6. **Global Economic Influences**: Other central banks, such as the ECB and BOC, have begun to cut rates, reflecting easing inflation pressures. The U.S. dollar has weakened against most major currencies.

7. **Future Monitoring**: The FOMC remains vigilant regarding inflation risks and is prepared to adjust monetary policy as needed based on incoming data and evolving economic conditions. The next meeting is scheduled for July 30-31, 2024.

In summary, the FOMC is committed to its dual mandate of achieving maximum employment and stable prices while navigating the uncertainties present in the economic outlook.
