## Instructions

1. **Interpret the Chart**  
   - Examine the hourly candles: note their size, direction (up or down), and relative consistency or variability.  
   - Look at the ATR(14) line below the chart:
     - Determine if the current ATR reading is higher, lower, or about average compared to its range over the last periods.
     - Note if the ATR has been rising or falling recently.

2. **Determine Volatility Level**  
   - Compare the latest ATR reading to its own recent historical values.  
   - Classify it as *high*, *medium*, or *low* based on whether it’s above, within, or below its recent typical range.  

3. **Identify Market State**  
   - If the candles show sustained directional movement (higher highs, higher lows or vice versa), classify it as *trending*.  
   - If candles are oscillating in a confined price band, classify it as *ranging*.  
   - If the most recent bars show a breakout or acceleration in volatility, note that as *potential trend initiation*.  

4. **Suggest Trading Approach**  
   - If high volatility: Recommend breakout/momentum strategies, with possible mention of wider stops and targets.  
   - If low volatility: Recommend range or mean‑reversion strategies, with mention of tighter stops and smaller targets.  
   - If the data suggests a shift in volatility (rising or falling), indicate possible caution or opportunity.

5. **Provide a Short Summary**  
   - Summarize in 2–3 sentences the overall market condition and key action points.  

**Go deep** with your analysis, do not just state the superficial observations.
