The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) held a meeting on September 17-18, 2024, where they reviewed recent financial market developments, economic conditions, and monetary policy actions. Key points from the minutes include:

1. **Financial Market Developments**: Nominal Treasury yields fell significantly due to weaker economic data and expectations of policy easing. Equity prices rose modestly, and credit spreads remained narrow. A brief period of market volatility occurred in early August, primarily due to speculative position unwinding.

2. **Policy Expectations**: Market expectations shifted towards a more aggressive easing of monetary policy, with a consensus for a 25 basis point cut at the meeting, although the likelihood of a 50 basis point cut had increased. Most participants did not foresee an imminent economic downturn.

3. **Economic Situation**: Real GDP growth remained solid, but job gains moderated, and the unemployment rate rose slightly to 4.2%. Inflation, while lower than the previous year, remained somewhat elevated, with core inflation at 2.6%. The labor market showed signs of easing, but conditions remained solid overall.

4. **International Developments**: Several central banks, including the Bank of England and the European Central Bank, continued to lower policy rates, contributing to a modest decline in the U.S. dollar index.

5. **Monetary Policy Decision**: The FOMC unanimously decided to lower the federal funds rate target range by 50 basis points to 4.75% to 5.00%. This decision was based on progress towards the 2% inflation target and the balance of risks in the economy.

6. **Outlook**: The staff forecasted continued solid economic growth, with inflation expected to decline further. Risks to economic activity were tilted to the downside, while inflation risks were seen as balanced. Participants expressed confidence that inflation was moving sustainably towards the 2% target.

7. **Future Meetings**: The next FOMC meeting is scheduled for November 6-7, 2024.

Overall, the FOMC's actions reflect a cautious approach to monetary policy, aiming to support economic growth while addressing inflation concerns. The decision to cut rates indicates a recognition of the evolving economic landscape and the need for flexibility in policy adjustments.
