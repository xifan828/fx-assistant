## European Central Bank

On December 12, 2024, the European Central Bank (ECB) announced a reduction of its three key interest rates by 25 basis points, responding to a favorable assessment of the inflation outlook and the effectiveness of monetary policy transmission. The new rates will take effect on December 18, 2024, with the deposit facility rate set at 3.00%, the main refinancing operations at 3.15%, and the marginal lending facility at 3.40%.

### Inflation Outlook
The ECB projects headline inflation to average 2.4% in 2024, decreasing to 2.1% in 2025, and further to 1.9% in 2026, before returning to 2.1% in 2027. Underlying inflation is expected to stabilize around the 2% target, although domestic inflation remains elevated at 4.2%, largely due to wage pressures and delayed adjustments in certain sectors.

### Economic Growth
Economic growth forecasts have been revised downward, with expectations of 0.7% growth in 2024, 1.1% in 2025, and 1.4% in 2026. The labor market remains robust, but a decrease in job vacancies suggests a potential slowdown in employment growth.

### Monetary Policy Approach
The ECB will adopt a data-dependent approach for future interest rate decisions, emphasizing flexibility without committing to a specific rate path. The removal of references to maintaining restrictive policies indicates a shift towards a more adaptable monetary stance, although current policies remain restrictive.

### Risks to the Economy
Downside risks to economic growth are acknowledged, influenced by global trade tensions, geopolitical uncertainties, and lingering effects of previous monetary tightening. Inflation risks are now viewed as two-sided, with potential for both upward and downward pressures depending on various factors.

### Financial Conditions
Market interest rates have decreased, easing financing conditions for businesses and households, although overall conditions remain tight. There has been a gradual improvement in bank lending, with increased borrowing activity.

### Conclusion
The ECB is committed to stabilizing inflation at the 2% target and will adjust its monetary policy tools as needed. The focus remains on data-driven decisions in response to changing economic conditions. ECB officials highlighted the importance of maintaining flexibility in their approach and acknowledged external risks while prioritizing price stability.
