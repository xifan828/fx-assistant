**Summary of the Federal Open Market Committee Minutes (December 17-18, 2024)**

**Meeting Overview:**
The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) convened to discuss financial market developments, economic conditions, and monetary policy. The meeting resulted in a unanimous decision to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4.25% - 4.50%.

**Financial Market Developments:**
- Treasury yields increased slightly since early November, primarily due to rising real yields.
- Market expectations for a federal funds rate cut were largely unchanged, with a consensus for a 25 basis point reduction at this meeting.
- There is considerable uncertainty regarding the future path of interest rates, with expectations for slower cuts in 2025.
- The U.S. dollar appreciated against most foreign currencies, influenced by diverging monetary policies between the U.S. and other advanced economies.

**Economic Situation:**
- Real GDP continued to expand solidly, with labor market conditions easing but unemployment remaining low at 4.2%.
- Inflation showed signs of easing, with total PCE inflation at 2.3% in October, down from 3.0% a year prior.
- Core inflation remained elevated, with participants noting that while disinflation was evident, it was slower than expected.

**Monetary Policy Considerations:**
- Participants expressed a balanced view on risks to achieving maximum employment and price stability, with some concerns about persistent inflation.
- The decision to lower the federal funds rate was seen as supportive of economic growth while continuing to address inflation.
- The FOMC emphasized the need for careful monitoring of incoming data and the evolving economic outlook.

**Outlook:**
- The staff projected solid economic conditions ahead, with GDP growth slightly slower than previously forecasted and inflation expected to remain around 2% by 2027.
- Risks to the economic outlook were viewed as balanced, although upside risks to inflation had increased due to stronger-than-expected readings and potential policy changes.

**Policy Actions:**
- The FOMC agreed to continue reducing its holdings of Treasury and agency securities.
- A technical adjustment was made to the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) facility rate, aligning it with the bottom of the federal funds rate target range.

**Conclusion:**
The FOMC remains committed to supporting maximum employment and returning inflation to the 2% target, while navigating the uncertainties in the economic landscape. The next meeting is scheduled for January 28-29, 2025.
