        "summary": "- The Russian rouble weakened slightly against the US dollar by 0.37% to 81.30, amid a lack of significant progress in Russia-US Ukraine war talks.\n- Despite the recent dip, the rouble has appreciated about 40% against the dollar year-to-date, indicating strong performance overall.\n- Rouble dynamics are closely tied to geopolitical developments and Russia-US negotiation news, per Sovcombank’s Mikhail Vasiliev.\n- Against the Chinese yuan (CNH), the rouble remained stable at 11.12, with the yuan being a key currency for Russia’s central bank interventions and Russia’s most traded foreign currency.\n- For USD/CNH traders, the stable RUB/CNH suggests limited immediate spillover from Russian geopolitical tensions into the yuan, but ongoing Russia-US relations and geopolitical risks could indirectly influence CNH sentiment and USD/CNH flows.\n- Market participants should monitor Russia-US diplomatic developments and geopolitical risk shifts as potential catalysts for volatility in USD/CNH via risk sentiment and safe-haven flows."
