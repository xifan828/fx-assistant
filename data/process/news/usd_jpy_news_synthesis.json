        "latest_insights": "Recent articles consistently highlight that the US dollar weakened following softer-than-expected US CPI inflation data for April, which rose 0.2% versus the 0.3% forecast, signaling easing inflation pressures. The 90-day US-China tariff truce has improved risk sentiment, lifting global equities and reducing safe-haven demand for the USD and JPY. Market expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts have been scaled back significantly, with June rate cut uncertainty and a shift of anticipated easing to September or later in 2025. Major banks have downgraded recession risks and moderated Fed easing forecasts, with USD/JPY forecasts generally lower for the medium term. Technical resistance near 148.7-149.0 caps near-term USD/JPY gains, while support around 147.1-147.3 is key for maintaining bullish momentum. Experts emphasize cautious Fed policy amid tariff uncertainties and inflation dynamics, suggesting a nuanced USD/JPY outlook sensitive to trade developments and Fed communications.",
        "recurring_themes": "Key recurring themes include the impact of softer US inflation data reducing immediate Fed rate cut pressure, the positive influence of the US-China tariff pause on risk sentiment and equities, and the resulting downward pressure on the USD and USD/JPY pair. Market participants have lowered recession fears and delayed Fed easing expectations, which tempers USD weakness. There is a consistent narrative of cautious Fed stance, tariff-related inflation risks, and technical resistance levels constraining USD/JPY upside. Brokerages' medium-term USD/JPY forecasts generally anticipate a weaker USD or stronger JPY, reflecting inflation and growth outlooks. The interplay between risk-on sentiment (which tends to weaken JPY) and fundamental USD moderation creates a complex environment for USD/JPY direction.",
        "market_sentiment": "Market sentiment is cautiously bearish to neutral on USD/JPY in the near term, driven by softer inflation data and improved trade relations that reduce safe-haven demand for USD and JPY. Finance professionals like Peter Cardillo and Brian Jacobsen emphasize a cautious Fed stance with uncertain near-term rate cuts, while major banks have lowered recession risks and moderated Fed easing expectations. The improved risk appetite supports equities and weighs on JPY, but persistent tariffs and inflation concerns limit USD downside. Overall, sentiment reflects a balance between risk-on optimism and structural economic uncertainties, leading to subdued USD/JPY volatility and restrained bullish momentum.",
        "major_factors": "Major factors influencing USD/JPY include the softer US CPI inflation print reducing pressure for aggressive Fed rate cuts, the 90-day US-China tariff truce boosting risk sentiment and equities, and the resulting diminished safe-haven demand for USD and JPY. Fed policy outlook is pivotal, with rate cut expectations pushed back and uncertainty around June easing. Treasury yields show mixed signals, reflecting nuanced market positioning. Technical resistance near 148.7-149.0 and support around 147.1-147.3 are critical for price action. Brokerages' medium-term forecasts incorporate inflation and growth dynamics, expecting USD moderation or JPY resilience. Traders are advised to monitor US inflation data, Fed communications, and trade developments closely for directional cues.",
        "conflicting_information": "There is some divergence between short-term and medium-term perspectives. While near-term risk-on sentiment from tariff optimism supports equities and tends to weaken JPY, medium-term forecasts from major banks generally predict a weaker USD/JPY due to expected USD moderation or stronger JPY amid inflation and growth concerns. Additionally, while softer inflation reduces immediate Fed rate hike pressure, tariffs are still expected to keep inflation elevated, potentially limiting the extent of Fed easing. Technical analysis shows resistance capping USD/JPY gains, but some experts remain cautiously bullish above key support levels. These differing views create a nuanced and somewhat conflicting outlook for USD/JPY direction.",
        "short_medium_term_outlook": "In the short term, USD/JPY is likely to face downward pressure from softer US inflation data and improved risk sentiment due to the tariff truce, with technical resistance near 148.7-149.0 limiting upside. Support around 147.1-147.3 is critical; a break below could shift momentum bearish. The Fed's cautious stance and delayed rate cut expectations suggest limited USD strength, while persistent tariffs and inflation risks maintain volatility. Medium term, brokerages forecast a weaker USD/JPY, reflecting expectations of USD moderation or JPY resilience amid evolving inflation and growth dynamics. Traders should closely watch US-China trade developments, Fed communications, and inflation data for directional guidance.",
        "summary": "Softer US inflation and a 90-day US-China tariff truce have eased immediate Fed rate cut expectations and boosted risk sentiment, pressuring the USD and USD/JPY lower in the near term. While improved risk appetite supports equities and tempers safe-haven demand for JPY, persistent tariffs and inflation concerns limit sustained USD weakness. Technical resistance near 148.7-149.0 caps upside, with medium-term forecasts generally favoring USD/JPY moderation amid cautious Fed policy and evolving economic conditions.",

        "latest_insights": "Recent articles consistently highlight that softer-than-expected US inflation data (CPI rising 0.2% vs. 0.3% forecast) combined with a 90-day US-China tariff truce have eased concerns about aggressive Fed tightening and recession risks. Market experts like Peter Cardillo and Brian Jacobsen emphasize a cautious Fed stance with delayed or uncertain rate cuts, now priced in mostly from September onward. The tariff easing has improved global risk sentiment, lifting Japanese equities (Nikkei +1.43%) and reducing safe-haven demand for JPY, causing short-term USD/JPY volatility around key technical levels near 148.7 resistance and 147.1 support. Major banks have lowered recession forecasts and moderated Fed easing expectations, projecting medium-term USD/JPY declines to 135-150 levels, reflecting anticipated USD moderation or JPY resilience amid evolving inflation and yield dynamics.",
        "recurring_themes": "Key recurring themes include softer US inflation reducing immediate Fed rate hike pressure, the positive impact of the US-China tariff pause on risk sentiment and equities, and a cautious Fed outlook delaying rate cuts. There is a consistent narrative of improved risk appetite supporting Japanese equities but simultaneously limiting JPY safe-haven strength. Market participants are closely watching tariff developments and Fed communications as primary drivers of USD/JPY direction. Technical resistance near 148.7-149.0 and support around 147.1-147.3 are repeatedly noted as critical levels for near-term momentum.",
        "market_sentiment": "Market sentiment is cautiously bullish on risk assets but mixed for USD/JPY. Finance professionals express a view that while softer inflation and tariff optimism weigh on the USD, limiting its strength, the Fed's cautious approach and delayed rate cuts cap USD downside. This creates a nuanced environment where USD/JPY faces downward pressure from a softer USD and improved risk sentiment but is also constrained by expectations of limited Fed easing. Overall, sentiment reflects prudence with traders awaiting clearer Fed signals and trade developments.",
        "major_factors": "Major factors influencing USD/JPY include the softer US CPI inflation print signaling manageable inflation pressures, the 90-day US-China tariff truce boosting risk appetite and equities, and the resulting moderation in Fed rate cut expectations. Treasury yields remain relatively stable but slightly elevated, supporting USD strength to some extent. Technical resistance near 148.7 and support near 147.1 are key for short-term price action. Industry experts highlight the interplay between easing trade tensions, inflation trajectory, and Fed policy outlook as central to USD/JPY movements.",
        "conflicting_information": "Some articles suggest that tariff easing and improved risk sentiment support JPY weakness due to reduced safe-haven demand, while others note that medium-term forecasts from major banks anticipate USD/JPY depreciation, implying either USD moderation or JPY strength. Additionally, while softer inflation reduces immediate Fed tightening pressure, there is caution that tariffs may keep inflation elevated longer term, potentially limiting Fed easing. These differing perspectives create a nuanced view on the balance of USD versus JPY strength going forward.",
        "short_medium_term_outlook": "In the short term, USD/JPY is likely to experience volatility around the 147.1 support and 148.7 resistance levels, with softer US inflation and tariff optimism exerting downward pressure on the pair. The medium-term outlook points to a potential gradual decline in USD/JPY as Fed rate cuts are delayed but expected later in the year, and as market participants price in a moderation of USD strength amid evolving inflation and yield dynamics. Traders should closely monitor US-China trade developments, Fed communications, and inflation data for directional cues.",
        "summary": "Softer US inflation and a 90-day US-China tariff truce have eased Fed tightening fears and boosted risk sentiment, pressuring the USD and causing USD/JPY to face near-term resistance around 148.7. While improved risk appetite supports Japanese equities and limits JPY safe-haven demand, cautious Fed rate cut expectations and stable Treasury yields cap USD downside. Traders should watch key technical levels and upcoming Fed and trade developments for guidance on USD/JPY direction.",
