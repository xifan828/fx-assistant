        "analysis": "Here is a Fed Outlook Summary based on the provided data:\n\nMarket expectations for Fed policy have shifted notably higher over the past month. For the upcoming meeting, the overwhelming consensus (91.7%) is now for rates to remain unchanged at 4.25-4.50%. This is a stark contrast to a month ago, when a cut to 4.00-4.25% was the dominant expectation (64.4%). Looking ahead to year-end, the implied rate has also moved higher. The 3.75-4.00% range is now the most probable outcome (37.8%), up significantly from a month ago. This indicates market participants expect fewer or later rate cuts than previously anticipated. The repricing suggests a less dovish outlook, potentially supporting higher yields or a stronger dollar."

        "analysis": "**Fed Outlook Summary: Market Expectations Shift Higher**\n\nMarket expectations for Fed policy have tightened considerably over the past month. For the upcoming FOMC meeting, the consensus has dramatically shifted from anticipating a rate cut (previously favoring 4.00-4.25%) to overwhelmingly expecting the Fed to hold steady at the current 4.25-4.50% range (91.8% probability).\n\nYear-end expectations have also moved higher. The most likely outcome is now seen in the 3.75-4.00% range, a notable increase from the 3.50-3.75% range favored a month ago. This repricing reflects reduced conviction in near-term rate cuts and aligns with a \"higher for longer\" narrative, implying less dovish sentiment priced into fixed income and potential USD support."

        "analysis": "Here is a Fed Outlook Summary based on the provided data:\n\nMarket-implied probabilities reveal a significant shift in Fed expectations over the past month. For the upcoming meeting, the consensus for holding the target rate at 4.25-4.50% has surged from 21.9% to an overwhelming 91.8%. This marks a dramatic change from a month ago when a further hike was widely anticipated.\n\nLooking towards year-end, the market continues to price in rate cuts. The implied rate of 3.84% suggests expectations for 50-100 basis points of easing from current levels, with the highest probabilities centered around the 350-400 bps range.\n\nThis outlook implies the market believes the Fed is likely done hiking for this cycle but anticipates economic conditions will necessitate cuts later in the year. This stance generally supports assets sensitive to future rate reductions while acknowledging the current restrictive policy environment."

        "analysis": "**Fed Outlook Summary: Market Expectations Shift Higher**\n\nMarket expectations for Fed policy have shifted materially over the past month. For the upcoming FOMC meeting, the consensus has solidified around holding rates steady at 4.25-4.50%, with a 91.7% probability now priced in, a dramatic increase from 24.5% a month ago. The probability of an immediate rate cut has been largely priced out.\n\nLooking towards year-end, expectations have also repriced higher. The market now anticipates fewer cuts than previously, with the implied rate centered around 3.88% and the highest probability assigned to the 3.75-4.00% range. This compares to a lower expected terminal rate a month ago. The shift suggests the market is reacting to stronger data, reducing the perceived urgency for easing and potentially supporting higher short-end yields."
