The decision reflects growing confidence that inflation is on track to return sustainably to the 2% target. Both headline and core inflation have continued to ease, with services inflation also cooling. Wage growth is moderating, and firms are absorbing some of the cost pressure. However, risks to the Euro Area outlook remain, especially due to rising global trade tensions, which are hurting confidence and tightening financial conditions. The ECB acknowledged that growth prospects have weakened and emphasized a data-dependent approach going forward. It made no commitment to further cuts, underlining that future decisions will depend on economic data, inflation dynamics, and the strength of monetary transmission.source:European Central Bank",

The pickup was supported by stronger domestic demand, driven by easing inflation, lower borrowing costs, renewed optimism following Germany's agreement to loosen fiscal constraints, and expectations of increased defense spending in the coming months. These developments helped offset persistent concerns over volatile U.S. tariff policies. However, economic momentum may soften in the months ahead, as the implementation of new U.S. duties begins to weigh on EU exports, while heightened uncertainty dampens investment and household consumption. Among major economies, Germany expanded by 0.2%, while Spain and Italy outperformed with growth rates of 0.6% and 0.3%, respectively.

Policymakers noted that uncertainty about the economic outlook has increased further and that the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen. During the regular press conference, Fed Chair Powell said that it's too early to determine whether inflation or unemployment will emerge as the greater concern, and the Fed does not need to rush into adjusting interest rates. The central bank can afford to be patient, monitoring incoming data and adopting a wait-and-see approach. The Fed also said that that although swings in net exports have affected the data, recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace.source:Federal Reserve",

The reading signaled a second consecutive month of contraction in the manufacturing sector as output shrank more sharply (44.0 vs. 48.3) and prices rose further (69.8 vs. 69.4). Meanwhile, new orders declined at a slower pace (47.2 vs. 45.2), though new export orders fell more steeply amid ongoing tariff-related disruptions. Meanwhile, the rate of job losses moderated slightly (46.5 vs. 44.7). The ISM survey also revealed U.S. manufacturers were grappling with rising costs and margin pressure, while ongoing trade uncertainty was disrupting supply chains, causing shipping delays, complex duties, and frequent changes in cost structures. At the same time, they said customer demand was becoming more volatile, with some clients delaying orders or pushing tariff costs back onto manufacturers.source:Institute for Supply Management",

The unanimous decision came amid rising concerns that U.S. President Trump's tariff measures could dampen both U.S. and global economic growth. Tokyo is currently negotiating a trade deal with Washington, which may influence future policy moves. The board signaled that it would raise rates if economic and price forecasts materialize. In its quarterly outlook, the BoJ lowered its FY 2025 GDP growth forecast to 0.5% from 1.0% projected in January, citing trade risks and policy uncertainty. The 2026 growth outlook was also reduced to 0.7% from 1.0%. The BoJ also trimmed its core inflation forecast for FY 2025 to 2.2% from 2.7% and expects it to ease further to 1.7% in FY 2026 before ticking up to 1.9% in FY 2027.

Core inflation has remained at or above the BOJ’s 2% target for nearly three years, driven by persistently high food prices and rising wages.

The decision reflects continued disinflation progress as external shocks eased and tight policy helped anchor inflation expectations. UK GDP growth has slowed since mid-2024, and the labour market is loosening. CPI inflation fell to 2.6% in March, though a temporary rise to 3.5% is expected in Q3 due to earlier energy price spikes. Inflation is forecast to ease again thereafter. Pay growth remains high but is expected to slow. Global uncertainty has risen due to new US tariffs, weakening global growth and lowering market interest rate expectations. The MPC remains committed to returning inflation to 2% sustainably. Future policy will depend on evolving risks and inflation dynamics. A cautious, data-driven approach to reducing policy restraint remains appropriate.source:Bank of England",

Transport also contributed to the slowdown (1.2% vs 1.8%), largely due to a 5.3% fall in motor fuel prices.

Non-food prices were flat after the prior 0.2% rise, as increases in housing (0.1% vs 0.1% in March), healthcare (0.2% vs 0.1%), and education (0.7% vs 0.8%) were offset by a sharper drop in transport cost (-3.9% vs -2.6%). On the food side, prices saw their smallest fall in three months, amid a sharp rebound in fresh food costs in the face of extreme weather, supply chain disruptions, and the impact of trade barriers. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and fuel prices, rose 0.5%, holding steady for the second month. On a monthly basis, the CPI edged up 0.1%, reversing a 0.4% drop in March and recording the first increase in three months.source:National Bureau of Statistics of China",

It marked the softest quarterly expansion since Q2 of 2024 while representing the 11th consecutive quarter of advance. Since February, U.S. President Donald Trump has sharply raised tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%, prompting Beijing to retaliate with duties on American imports. China's policymakers have emphasized that the nation has ample tools to support its economic output, with Premier Li Qiang recently pledging further stimulus. Boosting consumption remains a top priority this year as the government seeks to offset the impact of surging U.S. duties. The Politburo is expected to meet later in April to outline upcoming policy plans. In March, China announced increased fiscal spending, including a higher budget deficit, and officials have signaled more fiscal and monetary support ahead, following a wave of easing measures late last year.source:National Bureau of Statistics of China",

The decision reflects growing confidence that inflation is on track to return sustainably to the 2% target. Both headline and core inflation have continued to ease, with services inflation also cooling. Wage growth is moderating, and firms are absorbing some of the cost pressure. However, risks to the Euro Area outlook remain, especially due to rising global trade tensions, which are hurting confidence and tightening financial conditions. The ECB acknowledged that growth prospects have weakened and emphasized a data-dependent approach going forward. It made no commitment to further cuts, underlining that future decisions will depend on economic data, inflation dynamics, and the strength of monetary transmission.source:European Central Bank",

The pickup was supported by stronger domestic demand, driven by easing inflation, lower borrowing costs, renewed optimism following Germany's agreement to loosen fiscal constraints, and expectations of increased defense spending in the coming months. These developments helped offset persistent concerns over volatile U.S. tariff policies. However, economic momentum may soften in the months ahead, as the implementation of new U.S. duties begins to weigh on EU exports, while heightened uncertainty dampens investment and household consumption. Among major economies, Germany expanded by 0.2%, while Spain and Italy outperformed with growth rates of 0.6% and 0.3%, respectively.

Policymakers noted that uncertainty about the economic outlook has increased further and that the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen. During the regular press conference, Fed Chair Powell said that it's too early to determine whether inflation or unemployment will emerge as the greater concern, and the Fed does not need to rush into adjusting interest rates. The central bank can afford to be patient, monitoring incoming data and adopting a wait-and-see approach. The Fed also said that that although swings in net exports have affected the data, recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace.source:Federal Reserve",

Meanwhile, new orders declined at a slower pace (47.2 vs. 45.2), though new export orders fell more steeply amid ongoing tariff-related disruptions. Meanwhile, the rate of job losses moderated slightly (46.5 vs. 44.7). The ISM survey also revealed U.S. manufacturers were grappling with rising costs and margin pressure, while ongoing trade uncertainty was disrupting supply chains, causing shipping delays, complex duties, and frequent changes in cost structures. At the same time, they said customer demand was becoming more volatile, with some clients delaying orders or pushing tariff costs back onto manufacturers.source:Institute for Supply Management",

The unanimous decision came amid rising concerns that U.S. President Trump's tariff measures could dampen both U.S. and global economic growth. Tokyo is currently negotiating a trade deal with Washington, which may influence future policy moves. The board signaled that it would raise rates if economic and price forecasts materialize. In its quarterly outlook, the BoJ lowered its FY 2025 GDP growth forecast to 0.5% from 1.0% projected in January, citing trade risks and policy uncertainty. The 2026 growth outlook was also reduced to 0.7% from 1.0%. The BoJ also trimmed its core inflation forecast for FY 2025 to 2.2% from 2.7% and expects it to ease further to 1.7% in FY 2026 before ticking up to 1.9% in FY 2027.

The inflation figures arrive ahead of the BOJ’s policy meeting next week, where the central bank is expected to keep its benchmark rate unchanged at 0.5% and lower its growth forecasts. Core inflation has remained at or above the BOJ’s 2% target for nearly three years, driven by persistently high food prices and rising wages.

The decision reflects continued disinflation progress as external shocks eased and tight policy helped anchor inflation expectations. UK GDP growth has slowed since mid-2024, and the labour market is loosening. CPI inflation fell to 2.6% in March, though a temporary rise to 3.5% is expected in Q3 due to earlier energy price spikes. Inflation is forecast to ease again thereafter. Pay growth remains high but is expected to slow. Global uncertainty has risen due to new US tariffs, weakening global growth and lowering market interest rate expectations. The MPC remains committed to returning inflation to 2% sustainably. Future policy will depend on evolving risks and inflation dynamics. A cautious, data-driven approach to reducing policy restraint remains appropriate.source:Bank of England",

It marked the third consecutive month of consumer deflation, weighed by the combined effects of ongoing trade tensions with the US, weak domestic demand, and persistent employment uncertainty. Non-food prices were flat after the prior 0.2% rise, as increases in housing (0.1% vs 0.1% in March), healthcare (0.2% vs 0.1%), and education (0.7% vs 0.8%) were offset by a sharper drop in transport cost (-3.9% vs -2.6%). On the food side, prices saw their smallest fall in three months, amid a sharp rebound in fresh food costs in the face of extreme weather, supply chain disruptions, and the impact of trade barriers. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and fuel prices, rose 0.5%, holding steady for the second month. On a monthly basis, the CPI edged up 0.1%, reversing a 0.4% drop in March and recording the first increase in three months.source:National Bureau of Statistics of China",

It marked the softest quarterly expansion since Q2 of 2024 while representing the 11th consecutive quarter of advance. Since February, U.S. President Donald Trump has sharply raised tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%, prompting Beijing to retaliate with duties on American imports. China's policymakers have emphasized that the nation has ample tools to support its economic output, with Premier Li Qiang recently pledging further stimulus. Boosting consumption remains a top priority this year as the government seeks to offset the impact of surging U.S. duties. The Politburo is expected to meet later in April to outline upcoming policy plans. In March, China announced increased fiscal spending, including a higher budget deficit, and officials have signaled more fiscal and monetary support ahead, following a wave of easing measures late last year.source:National Bureau of Statistics of China",
