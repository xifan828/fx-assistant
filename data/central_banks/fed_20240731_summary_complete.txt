## Federal Open Market Committee US

The latest statement from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) indicates that the U.S. economy is expanding at a solid pace, although job gains have moderated and the unemployment rate has slightly increased while remaining low. Inflation has eased over the past year but is still somewhat elevated, with recent progress toward the Committee's 2% inflation target.

The FOMC has decided to maintain the federal funds rate target range at 5-1/4 to 5-1/2 percent, emphasizing that any future adjustments will depend on incoming data and the evolving economic outlook. The Committee does not foresee reducing the target range until there is greater confidence that inflation is sustainably moving toward the 2% goal. Additionally, the FOMC will continue to reduce its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt.

The economic outlook remains uncertain, with the Committee prepared to adjust monetary policy as necessary if risks to employment or inflation emerge. The FOMC's assessments will consider a wide range of information, including labor market conditions and inflation expectations.

In the minutes from the July 30-31, 2024 meeting, it was noted that financial conditions have eased slightly, with lower long-term interest rates and higher equity prices. The labor market is showing signs of moderation, with the unemployment rate rising to 4.1% and consumer price inflation at 2.5%. The economic growth forecast for the second half of 2024 has been lowered, with inflation expected to decline further towards the 2% target by 2026.

Overall, the FOMC is taking a cautious approach to monetary policy, focusing on stability and closely monitoring economic developments as they assess the appropriate stance moving forward.
