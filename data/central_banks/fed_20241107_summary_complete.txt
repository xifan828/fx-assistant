## Federal Open Market Committee US

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) recently convened on November 6-7, 2024, and made several key announcements regarding the U.S. economy and monetary policy:

1. **Economic Activity**: The economy continues to expand solidly, with easing labor market conditions and a low unemployment rate. Inflation has progressed towards the 2% target but remains elevated.

2. **Monetary Policy Adjustment**: The FOMC decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to 4.5% - 4.75%. This decision reflects a careful assessment of incoming data and the evolving economic outlook.

3. **Inflation and Employment Goals**: The Committee remains committed to achieving maximum employment and returning inflation to the 2% objective. They will monitor various economic indicators, including labor market conditions and inflation pressures, to guide future policy adjustments.

4. **Financial Market Developments**: Treasury yields have risen due to stronger economic data, and equity prices have increased, indicating an improved economic outlook. The path for the federal funds rate is expected to shift upward, with potential for further cuts in upcoming meetings.

5. **International Context**: Global policy rate expectations have declined, strengthening the U.S. dollar. While inflation has eased in many advanced economies, some regions, particularly in Latin America, are experiencing rising inflation.

6. **Risks and Concerns**: The FOMC acknowledged potential risks to the economic outlook, including geopolitical tensions and possible slowdowns in economic activity. Concerns about financial stability, particularly in commercial real estate, were also raised.

The FOMC's discussions reflect a cautious optimism about the economy while emphasizing the importance of ongoing monitoring of inflation and employment trends. The next meeting is scheduled for December 17-18, 2024.
