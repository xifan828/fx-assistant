## Bank of Japan

The Bank of Japan (BoJ) has released its Outlook for Economic Activity and Prices for October 2024, highlighting several key points regarding Japan's economic growth and inflation expectations:

1. **Economic Growth**: Japan's economy is projected to grow at a pace above its potential growth rate, supported by moderate growth in overseas economies and a strengthening virtuous cycle from income to spending, aided by accommodative financial conditions.

2. **Inflation Projections**: The year-on-year increase in the consumer price index (CPI), excluding fresh food, is expected to be around 2.5% for fiscal 2024, tapering to approximately 2% for fiscal 2025 and 2026. This reflects a gradual increase in underlying inflation due to an improving output gap and rising medium- to long-term inflation expectations.

3. **Consumer Prices**: The effects of past increases in import prices on consumer prices are anticipated to diminish, while the government's measures to alleviate inflationary pressures are expected to contribute positively to CPI growth in the coming years.

4. **Risks to the Outlook**: The BoJ acknowledges high uncertainties surrounding economic activity and prices, particularly regarding developments in overseas economies, commodity prices, and domestic wage and price-setting behaviors. The balance of risks to economic activity is generally seen as balanced, while risks to prices are skewed to the upside for fiscal 2025.

5. **Current Economic Conditions**: Japan's economy has shown moderate recovery, with improvements in corporate profits and business sentiment. Private consumption is on a moderate upward trend, despite some impacts from rising prices. Employment and income conditions are also improving, contributing to sustained consumer spending.

6. **Monetary Policy Outlook**: The BoJ plans to adjust its monetary policy in response to economic developments, particularly focusing on the balance between supporting growth and achieving its price stability target of 2%. The bank will closely monitor financial and foreign exchange market developments, as these could significantly impact Japan's economic activity and inflation.

Overall, the BoJ's outlook indicates cautious optimism about Japan's economic trajectory, with a focus on managing inflation and supporting sustainable growth amidst various domestic and global uncertainties.
