The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) held a meeting on June 11-12, 2024, where members discussed current economic conditions and monetary policy. Key points from the minutes include:

1. **Economic Activity**: The U.S. economy is expanding at a solid pace, with strong job gains and a low unemployment rate. However, inflation remains elevated, with modest progress towards the 2% target.

2. **Financial Conditions**: Financial conditions have eased slightly, driven by higher equity prices and a consensus that the federal funds rate has peaked. Treasury yields have declined, particularly real yields, while inflation expectations remain anchored.

3. **Monetary Policy Outlook**: The FOMC decided to maintain the federal funds rate target range at 5.25% to 5.50%. Participants expressed a cautious approach to future rate cuts, emphasizing the need for more data to confirm that inflation is moving sustainably towards the 2% goal.

4. **Inflation Dynamics**: While inflation has eased, participants noted that progress has been slower than expected. Factors contributing to ongoing inflation include persistent price pressures in certain sectors and the potential for elevated inflation due to geopolitical risks and fiscal policy.

5. **Labor Market**: The labor market is showing signs of balance, with a slight increase in the unemployment rate and a decrease in job openings. However, wage growth remains above levels consistent with price stability.

6. **Global Economic Context**: Internationally, central banks like the ECB and BOC have initiated rate cuts, reflecting easing inflation pressures. The U.S. dollar has depreciated against most advanced economy currencies.

7. **Future Considerations**: The FOMC remains attentive to inflation risks and will adjust monetary policy as necessary based on incoming data and economic conditions. The next meeting is scheduled for July 30-31, 2024.

Overall, the FOMC is committed to achieving its dual mandate of maximum employment and stable prices, while navigating uncertainties in the economic outlook.
