        "latest_insights": "Recent US CPI inflation data showed a softer-than-expected rise of 0.2% in April and May, signaling manageable inflation pressures and reducing urgency for aggressive Fed rate hikes. The US-China 90-day tariff truce has eased trade tensions significantly, boosting risk sentiment and lowering recession fears, which has supported EUR/USD gains. Market consensus among finance professionals, including Peter Cardillo and Brian Jacobsen, suggests a cautious Fed stance with delayed rate cuts, while major banks have downgraded recession risks and pushed back expected easing to later in 2024. Technically, EUR/USD is approaching a critical resistance zone near 1.1193-1.1213, with key support at 1.11452 and 1.10395, indicating a modestly bullish near-term bias if resistance is broken.",
        "recurring_themes": "Key recurring themes include softer US inflation reducing Fed rate hike expectations, easing US-China trade tensions improving risk appetite, and tariff-related inflation risks remaining a wildcard. Market participants widely acknowledge the tariff truce as a positive catalyst for risk assets and EUR/USD, though some caution remains due to historically high tariff levels that could still weigh on US growth. The divergence in EUR/USD forecasts among major banks reflects uncertainty around US monetary policy, inflation trajectory, and Eurozone economic momentum. Technical analysis consistently highlights critical resistance and support levels that will guide near-term EUR/USD direction.",
        "market_sentiment": "Market sentiment is cautiously optimistic with a tilt towards risk-on, driven by softer inflation data and the US-China tariff pause. Finance professionals generally view the Fed's cautious approach as appropriate, with delayed rate cuts expected rather than aggressive easing or hikes. The improved risk environment supports euro strength against the dollar, but lingering tariff-related growth concerns and mixed economic outlooks temper overly bullish expectations. Overall, the market favors moderate EUR/USD upside while remaining vigilant for shifts in trade developments and Fed communications.",
        "major_factors": "Major factors influencing EUR/USD include the softer US inflation readings that reduce pressure on the Fed to hike rates aggressively, the 90-day US-China tariff truce that has eased trade war fears and boosted risk sentiment, and the evolving Fed rate cut expectations now priced at roughly 50-56 basis points for 2024. Tariff-related inflation remains a key risk that could alter Fed policy and USD strength if it intensifies. Technical resistance near 1.12 and support near 1.1145 and 1.1040 are critical for price action. Additionally, divergent economic growth forecasts for the US and Eurozone contribute to uncertainty in EUR/USD direction.",
        "conflicting_information": "While most experts agree on the positive impact of softer inflation and tariff easing on EUR/USD, some caution remains regarding the sustained high tariff levels that could continue to pressure US growth and inflation. This introduces a potential ceiling on euro gains versus the dollar. Furthermore, there is divergence among major banks on EUR/USD forecasts for 2025, ranging from bearish (around 0.98) to bullish (up to 1.20), reflecting differing views on US monetary policy, inflation trajectory, and Eurozone economic momentum. These conflicting perspectives underscore the uncertainty and need for close monitoring of key economic and trade developments.",
        "short_medium_term_outlook": "In the short term, EUR/USD is modestly bullish with potential to break above the 1.1213 resistance zone, which would strengthen upside momentum. Support at 1.1145 and 1.1040 levels will be critical to maintain this bullish bias. Medium-term outlook remains cautiously optimistic as softer US inflation and easing trade tensions support euro strength, but tariff-related inflation risks and mixed economic growth forecasts could cap gains. Traders should closely watch US inflation data, Fed communications, and US-China trade developments for directional cues, as these remain the primary drivers of EUR/USD movements.",
        "summary": "Softer US inflation and a 90-day US-China tariff truce have eased fears of aggressive Fed hikes and recession, boosting risk sentiment and supporting EUR/USD gains. Market professionals broadly expect a cautious Fed with delayed rate cuts, while technical resistance near 1.12 is pivotal for further upside. However, lingering tariff-related inflation risks and mixed economic outlooks inject uncertainty, making close monitoring of trade and Fed signals essential for EUR/USD traders.",

        "latest_insights": "Recent articles consistently highlight that US consumer inflation rose by 0.2% in April, below expectations, signaling manageable inflation pressures and reducing urgency for aggressive Fed tightening. The 90-day US-China tariff pause, significantly lowering tariffs, has eased trade war fears, boosted risk sentiment, and led to a weaker US dollar. Market pricing now anticipates fewer Fed rate cuts this year, reflecting improved confidence in inflation control and trade d√©tente. Experts like Peter Cardillo and Brian Jacobsen emphasize the cautious Fed stance and the potential for resumed rate cuts later in 2024 if trade tensions ease further. However, economists such as Christopher Hodge warn that tariffs remain historically high, potentially limiting sustained USD weakness and US growth. Technical analysis shows EUR/USD approaching a key resistance zone near 1.1213, with modestly bullish momentum while above 1.1145. Major brokerages have lowered US recession risks amid tariff optimism, improving risk appetite and supporting EUR/USD upside, though forecasts vary widely due to uncertainties in US monetary policy and Eurozone growth.",
        "recurring_themes": "Key recurring themes include softer-than-expected US inflation reducing Fed tightening urgency, the significant impact of the US-China 90-day tariff pause easing trade tensions, and improved global risk sentiment favoring risk currencies like the euro over the dollar. There is a consensus that tariffs, despite reductions, remain elevated and continue to pose inflationary and growth risks. Market expectations for Fed rate cuts have moderated, with a shift from aggressive easing to a more cautious, data-dependent approach. Risk appetite improvements have lowered recession fears and supported equities, while technical resistance levels around 1.12 for EUR/USD are closely watched. Divergent forecasts from major banks reflect ongoing uncertainty around US inflation trajectory, Fed policy, and Eurozone economic momentum.",
        "market_sentiment": "Market sentiment is cautiously optimistic with a tilt towards risk-on, driven by softer US inflation data and the temporary easing of US-China trade tensions. Finance professionals generally view the Fed's cautious stance as appropriate given current data, with some expecting delayed or moderate rate cuts later in 2024. The dollar is under pressure due to reduced rate cut expectations and improved risk appetite, supporting euro gains. However, lingering concerns about high tariffs and their inflationary impact temper enthusiasm, suggesting that while EUR/USD has upside potential, gains may be capped. Overall, sentiment favors modest euro appreciation against a cautious dollar backdrop, with vigilance on trade developments and Fed communications.",
        "major_factors": "Major factors influencing EUR/USD include the softer US inflation data signaling manageable price pressures, the 90-day US-China tariff pause significantly easing trade war fears, and the resulting improved global risk appetite. Fed policy expectations have shifted, with markets pricing in fewer rate cuts this year, reflecting confidence in inflation control but also caution due to tariff-related inflation risks. Treasury yields movements indicate a tempered Fed outlook. Technical resistance near 1.1213 for EUR/USD is a critical level for further upside. Additionally, lowered US recession risks by major brokerages amid tariff optimism support risk currencies. Divergent economic growth forecasts for the US and Eurozone add complexity to the outlook.",
        "conflicting_information": "While there is broad agreement on the positive impact of softer US inflation and tariff easing on EUR/USD, some experts caution that tariffs remain historically high and could sustain inflationary pressures, potentially limiting the dollar's weakness and euro's upside. There is also divergence in EUR/USD forecasts among major banks, ranging from bearish (around 0.98) to bullish (up to 1.20) over the next 12 months, reflecting differing views on US monetary policy, inflation trajectory, and Eurozone growth. Some analysts emphasize the possibility of resumed Fed rate cuts later in 2024 if trade tensions ease further, while others highlight the cautious Fed stance and question near-term easing. These differing perspectives underscore uncertainty around the durability of current trends.",
        "short_medium_term_outlook": "In the short term, EUR/USD is poised for modest gains supported by softer US inflation, reduced Fed rate cut expectations, and improved risk sentiment from the US-China tariff pause. Technical resistance near 1.1213 is a key level to watch; a decisive break could accelerate euro strength. Medium-term outlook remains cautiously bullish but tempered by lingering tariff-related inflation risks and subdued Eurozone growth prospects. Market participants should closely monitor US inflation data, Fed communications, and trade developments for directional cues, as these will influence the balance between risk-on sentiment and safe-haven demand, shaping EUR/USD trajectory through 2024.",
        "summary": "Softer US inflation and a temporary US-China tariff truce have eased trade tensions, boosting risk appetite and weakening the dollar, which supports EUR/USD gains near key resistance around 1.12. While the Fed's cautious stance and reduced rate cut expectations underpin euro strength, persistent high tariffs and mixed economic growth forecasts inject uncertainty, capping upside potential. Traders should monitor Fed signals and trade developments closely, as these remain pivotal drivers for EUR/USD direction in the near to medium term.",
