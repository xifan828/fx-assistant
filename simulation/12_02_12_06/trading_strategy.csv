There is a potential ascending channel formation, indicating a continuation of bullish momentum with support levels around 1.0570. The analysis highlights potential buy opportunities on dips near 1.0570 targeting 1.0600, with caution advised if prices break below 1.0560.
The 5-day technical analysis reveals a bearish trend that may be reversing with a bounce from 1.0471 to 1.0579. Despite the previous broad bearish trend, recent price actions suggest a shift towards a bullish reversal, aiming for resistance levels at 1.0591 and 1.0600-1.0620. This analysis supports short-term bullish trades with an entry around 1.0570-1.0580, provided resistance levels are tested and surpassed.
The 3-month technical analysis underscores a prevailing bearish trend since early September, with a potential double bottom suggesting a reversal if 1.0580 is broken. A breakout above this resistance could target levels around 1.0608 or higher, possibly reaching 1.0664. The bearish trend, however, should be kept in mind, indicating a need for cautious bullish positioning.

The most significant immediate factor is the expectations around the U.S. jobs report, where a higher-than-expected number of jobs added could strengthen the USD and weaken EUR/USD. Meanwhile, anticipation of a Federal Reserve rate cut could counteract this by weakening the USD. Political instability in Europe, particularly France, adds further uncertainty. The significant FX option expiries at 1.0600 provide a cap on upward movement, making this a strong resistance level.
The technical analysis indicates that the EUR/USD is in a short-term bullish trend, showing higher highs and higher lows. The immediate resistance lies at 1.0590, which aligns closely with the significant FX option level at 1.0600 mentioned in the news.

Additionally, economic indicators such as Jobless Claims might hint at broader economic performance, potentially impacting USD strength and market sentiment.Given the current bullish short-term technical outlook for EUR/USD and expecting potential volatility from the U.S. job report, we're likely to see testing of immediate resistance at 1.0590. However, considering the strong resistance imposed by both the technicals and FX option expiries around 1.0600, as well as political uncertainty in Europe, the pair might struggle to break higher until significant news developments occur.

A stronger-than-expected jobs report could challenge this expectation and result in dollar strength, while weaker data would support the euro.
Technical analysis shows that the EUR/USD pair has been trading near a key resistance level at 1.0590-1.0600.
