            "risk_sentiment_analysis": "The overall risk sentiment appears slightly risk-off to neutral. The S&P 500 shows a marginal decline (-0.06%), indicating subdued equity market performance. Gold prices have dropped significantly (-2.05%), which typically signals reduced safe-haven demand, but Brent Oil also declined (-0.99%), reflecting some risk aversion or demand concerns. The VIX decreased slightly (-0.77%), suggesting lower volatility expectations. Bond yields in both the US and Germany rose modestly, with US yields increasing more sharply, maintaining a positive yield spread favoring the USD.",
            "key_market_drivers": "The primary market drivers include the cautious equity market performance, the sharp decline in gold prices, and rising US Treasury yields relative to German bunds. The modest increase in US yields versus German yields supports the USD, while softer commodity prices and mixed equity signals reflect uncertainty. The slight strengthening of the DXY (+0.06%) amid these factors highlights the influence of yield differentials and cautious risk sentiment. Additionally, easing US-China trade tensions and softer US inflation data are key fundamental drivers shaping market expectations and Fed policy outlook.",
            "implications_for_trading": "The slightly risk-off to neutral sentiment combined with rising US yields relative to Germany supports a modestly stronger USD, putting pressure on EUR/USD, which is reflected in its slight decline (-0.07%). The narrow US-Germany yield spreads suggest limited but persistent interest rate advantage for the USD. Traders should watch for technical resistance near 1.126 and support around 1.119 in EUR/USD. Potential trading opportunities include short EUR/USD positions if bearish momentum below support intensifies, while any further easing in trade tensions or softer US inflation could provide upside risks. Monitoring Fed and ECB policy signals will be crucial for directional cues.",
            "conclusion": "Market tone is cautiously balanced with slight risk-off undertones amid mixed signals from equities, commodities, and yields. EUR/USD traders should remain vigilant around key technical levels, as the interplay of easing trade tensions and Fed policy uncertainty could drive near-term volatility and directional shifts.",

Gold and Brent Oil prices have declined notably (-2.05% and -0.99% respectively), which typically signals a reduced safe-haven demand and a tilt towards risk-on sentiment. The VIX volatility index is down slightly (-0.77%), reinforcing a modestly calmer market. US Treasury yields have risen modestly, with the 2Y yield up 0.80% and the 10Y yield up 0.60%, while Japanese yields show mixed changes, resulting in a very narrow US-Japan yield spread of about 3 basis points. This narrow spread and stable yields reflect limited divergence in monetary policy expectations between the US and Japan. Overall, the market exhibits a slightly risk-on sentiment driven by easing trade tensions and softer US inflation data reducing immediate Fed tightening fears.",
            "key_market_drivers": "The primary market drivers include softer US inflation data and cautious Federal Reserve commentary, which have tempered expectations for aggressive rate hikes and contributed to stable US Treasury yields. Easing US-China trade tensions have improved global risk appetite, reflected in declining gold and oil prices and a modest drop in volatility. The narrow US-Japan yield spread limits carry trade incentives, while regional currency strength, such as the Korean won, indirectly pressures USD/JPY. Mixed equity signals and geopolitical uncertainties add complexity but the dominant forces remain inflation data, Fed guidance, and risk sentiment shifts.",
            "implications_for_trading": "The slightly risk-on environment and narrow US-Japan yield spreads suggest limited upward pressure on USD/JPY from interest rate differentials. Softer US inflation and cautious Fed outlook reduce the USD's safe-haven appeal, contributing to USD weakness against the JPY. The observed decline in USD/JPY (-0.53%) aligns with these dynamics. Traders should anticipate range-bound trading with a downward bias for USD/JPY, sensitive to upcoming US economic data and Fed communications. Potential trading opportunities lie in tactical short USD/JPY positions on risk-on shifts, but risks remain from geopolitical uncertainties and possible volatility spikes.",
            "conclusion": "The market tone is cautiously risk-on with USD/JPY facing near-term downside pressure amid softer US inflation and stable yields.

The VIX volatility index has decreased slightly, signaling lower market fear. Bond yields in both the US and UK have risen modestly, with UK yields increasing slightly more, and yield spreads between US and UK bonds are nearly flat, reflecting balanced interest rate expectations.",
            "key_market_drivers": "The primary market drivers currently are the softer US inflation data and dovish Federal Reserve commentary, which are weakening the US dollar and supporting GBP/USD gains. Technical factors, especially key moving averages on GBP/USD charts, are also influential. UK economic data and Bank of England policy expectations add complexity, while easing US-China trade tensions and improved global growth sentiment bolster risk appetite, favoring risk-sensitive currencies like GBP. Commodity price declines and stable equity indices suggest cautious optimism rather than strong risk-on sentiment.",
            "implications_for_trading": "The broadly weaker US dollar driven by subdued inflation and dovish Fed signals supports GBP/USD appreciation, but the pair faces resistance from mixed UK growth prospects and potential BoE easing. The near parity in US-UK yield spreads limits strong carry-driven moves, making technical levels and upcoming economic data critical for direction. Traders should watch US inflation and Fed speeches for USD momentum shifts, and UK GDP and labor data for sterling strength. The slight risk-off signals from commodity prices and flat equity performance suggest cautious positioning, with potential for modest GBP/USD gains if technical support holds.",

US Treasury yields have risen modestly, with the 2Y yield up 0.80% and the 10Y yield up 0.60%, indicating expectations of a less aggressive Fed rate cut timeline. The narrow US-China yield spreads (around 2.6-2.8 bps) suggest limited divergence in monetary policy but still favor the USD slightly due to higher US yields.",
            "key_market_drivers": "The primary market drivers include the US-China tariff truce which has boosted risk sentiment and led to a significant appreciation of the Chinese yuan. Softer US inflation data has moderated Fed rate cut expectations, supporting higher US yields and a stronger dollar. The PBOC's cautious interventions to slow yuan appreciation also play a key role in managing currency volatility. Additionally, easing geopolitical tensions contribute to improved risk appetite. These factors collectively shape the current environment where risk assets and the yuan benefit, while safe havens like gold weaken.",
            "implications_for_trading": "The improved risk sentiment and tariff truce favor yuan strength against the USD, pressuring USD/CNH lower despite modestly higher US yields. The small US-China yield spread limits USD strength, while PBOC interventions cap rapid yuan appreciation, creating a controlled environment for USD/CNH. Traders should watch for upcoming US inflation and retail sales data that could shift Fed policy expectations and impact USD/CNH direction. Potential trading opportunities lie in short USD/CNH positions on risk-on sentiment, but caution is warranted due to the temporary nature of the tariff truce and PBOC's active currency management.",
            "conclusion": "Market tone is cautiously optimistic with risk-on sentiment supported by the US-China tariff truce and softer US inflation, leading to yuan strength tempered by PBOC interventions.

Rising US Treasury yields relative to German Bunds provide a mild USD yield advantage, while weaker gold and oil prices suggest some underlying caution.

            "risk_sentiment_analysis": "Global equity indices present a mixed but cautiously optimistic picture: the S&P 500 and Nasdaq show modest gains, indicating a slightly risk-on environment, while the STOXX50 is slightly down and MSCI EM is flat, reflecting regional divergences. Commodity prices, particularly gold's sharp decline (-2.06%), suggest reduced safe-haven demand consistent with improved risk appetite, though Brent oil is flat, indicating no strong commodity-driven risk signals. Bond yields in both the US and Germany have risen, with US yields increasing more sharply, widening the US-Germany yield spreads slightly, which points to expectations of a relatively more hawkish Fed stance compared to the ECB. The VIX's modest rise (+2.25%) signals some underlying market caution despite the overall slightly positive equity moves.",
            "key_market_drivers": "The primary market drivers currently are the easing US-China trade tensions improving risk sentiment, the cautious Fed stance reflected in rising US yields and yield spreads, and technical bearish momentum in EUR/USD. Equities gains in the US and stable commodity prices support risk appetite, while rising US yields relative to German yields reinforce USD strength. The technical resistance levels in EUR/USD and tariff-related inflation risks also weigh heavily on currency dynamics, making bond yields and trade policy developments the dominant forces shaping the market.",
            "implications_for_trading": "The slightly risk-on sentiment combined with widening US-Germany yield spreads supports a firmer USD, putting downward pressure on EUR/USD, consistent with the technical bearish momentum below key moving averages. Traders should be cautious of potential further downside in EUR/USD if support levels around 1.1193–1.1213 break, especially ahead of key US data releases and Fed Chair Powell's remarks. The cautious Fed stance and tariff uncertainties may limit USD downside, suggesting range-bound trading with a bias toward USD strength. USD/JPY and other major pairs may also reflect this dynamic, with the USD benefiting from higher yields and improved risk appetite, but tempered by geopolitical and inflation concerns.",
            "conclusion": "The market tone is cautiously optimistic with a slightly risk-on bias supported by easing trade tensions and rising US yields, but tariff-related inflation risks and Fed caution cap EUR/USD upside. EUR/USD traders should prepare for potential near-term downside pressure amid bearish technical signals and monitor upcoming US economic data and Fed communications for directional clarity.",

Gold prices have dropped significantly, reflecting reduced safe-haven demand, while Brent Oil is stable, suggesting no major commodity-driven risk shifts. The VIX has risen modestly, signaling some market nervousness. US Treasury yields have increased notably, with the 2Y and 10Y yields up around 1%, while Japanese yields have risen marginally, resulting in a very narrow US-Japan yield spread of about 3 basis points, indicating limited interest rate differential impact.",
            "key_market_drivers": "The primary market drivers include the cautious improvement in global risk appetite reflected in US equities and the decline in gold, signaling reduced safe-haven flows. The modest rise in US Treasury yields alongside stable Japanese yields keeps yield spreads tight, limiting carry trade incentives. USD/JPY remains range-bound near technical support levels, influenced by trade negotiations and Fed policy uncertainty. The interplay of easing trade tensions, Fed's wait-and-see approach, and tariff-related inflation risks are key factors shaping market dynamics.",
            "implications_for_trading": "The slightly risk-on sentiment with modest US yield increases and minimal US-Japan yield spread suggests limited directional momentum for USD/JPY, supporting range-bound trading around 146.7. Reduced safe-haven demand and cautious optimism favor USD strength over JPY, but persistent tariff uncertainties and delayed Fed rate cut expectations cap upside potential. Traders should watch for Fed Chair Powell's remarks and trade negotiation developments as catalysts for volatility. Potential exists for yen appreciation if dollar softness continues, but improved risk appetite may restrain significant yen gains, presenting opportunities for tactical range trading rather than strong directional bets.",
            "conclusion": "The market tone is cautiously optimistic with mixed signals from equities, yields, and commodities, resulting in range-bound but volatile USD/JPY trading. USD/JPY traders should focus on key technical levels and upcoming Fed and trade developments, favoring a measured approach amid limited yield spread-driven momentum and evolving risk sentiment.",

Gold prices have dropped sharply (-2.06%), suggesting reduced safe-haven demand, while Brent Oil is stable, reflecting neutral commodity-driven risk sentiment. Bond yields in both the US and UK have risen modestly (~+1%), with near parity in US-UK yield spreads, signaling steady interest rate expectations and a cautious Fed stance.",
            "key_market_drivers": "The primary market drivers currently are the cautious Federal Reserve policy outlook amid tariff-related inflation uncertainty, easing US-China trade tensions improving risk sentiment, and mixed USD momentum influenced by softer US inflation data. US Treasury yields and technical levels in GBP/USD are also key factors shaping market dynamics, alongside equity performance and gold price movements reflecting risk sentiment shifts.",
            "implications_for_trading": "The slightly risk-on environment with modestly higher US yields and a stable DXY suggests limited USD weakness, which constrains GBP/USD upside. The near-zero US-UK yield spreads imply little fundamental advantage for GBP over USD, while technical support near 1.3256 is critical for GBP/USD direction. Traders should watch for potential downside if key moving averages break, but a rebound above the 200-hour moving average could open bullish momentum. The cautious Fed stance and tariff uncertainties pose risks for GBP/USD, favoring range-bound trading with a slight bearish bias in the near term.",
            "conclusion": "The market tone is cautiously optimistic but mixed, with risk sentiment supported by easing trade tensions yet tempered by tariff-driven inflation risks and a patient Fed. GBP/USD traders should focus on technical support levels and upcoming US data for directional cues, preparing for limited upside and potential downside risks if key supports fail.",

Commodity prices show a decline in gold (-2.06%), which typically signals reduced safe-haven demand and supports risk-on bias, while Brent oil is nearly unchanged, providing little directional cue. The VIX has risen modestly (+2.25%), indicating some increase in market volatility or caution. US Treasury yields have risen notably (2Y +1.05%, 10Y +0.96%), reflecting expectations of sustained Fed policy or improving growth prospects, while Chinese yields also increased but remain significantly lower, maintaining a wide yield spread. The US-China 2Y and 10Y yield spreads are narrow (~2.6-2.9 bps), suggesting limited interest rate differential impact currently.",
            "key_market_drivers": "The primary drivers shaping the current market environment are the US-China 90-day tariff truce which has boosted risk sentiment and yuan strength, softer US CPI inflation data which has eased fears of aggressive Fed tightening and delayed rate cuts, and Chinese state-owned banks' interventions to manage yuan appreciation. Equities gains in the US and subdued moves in Europe and emerging markets reflect cautious optimism. Rising US yields support the dollar broadly but are tempered by softer inflation data. Gold's sharp decline underscores reduced safe-haven demand. The interplay of trade optimism, policy interventions, and inflation data are the key forces influencing USD/CNH dynamics.",
            "implications_for_trading": "The slightly risk-on environment supported by the tariff truce and easing trade tensions favors yuan strength, but Chinese policy interventions cap rapid appreciation. Narrow US-China yield spreads limit carry trade advantages for USD/CNH, while softer US inflation data and delayed Fed rate cuts weigh on the dollar. For USD/CNH traders, this suggests limited downside for the dollar with capped yuan gains in the near term. Monitoring PBOC policy signals and US economic data will be critical as shifts could quickly alter the risk sentiment and yield differentials, impacting USD/CNH volatility and direction. Potential trading opportunities lie in tactical plays around PBOC interventions and US data releases, while risks include renewed geopolitical tensions or unexpected Fed policy shifts.",
            "conclusion": "The market exhibits cautious optimism with a slightly risk-on tone driven by trade optimism and softer US inflation, supporting yuan strength but constrained by Chinese policy actions. USD/CNH traders should prepare for limited yuan appreciation and moderate dollar pressure, remaining vigilant to policy and geopolitical developments that could disrupt this balance.",
