While recent trade disputes and US tariffs are expected to weigh on economic growth, ECB officials still see a clear path to achieving price stability as disinflationary forces are likely to dominate in the short term. However, some policymakers cautioned that a prolonged trade war could cause long-term inflationary effects by disrupting global supply chains. At the April meeting, the ECB implemented its seventh rate cut in the past year and is widely expected to reduce rates again on June 5, with markets assigning a 90% probability to another cut. Investors also anticipate one further rate reduction later this year, after which the ECB’s deposit rate is projected to stabilize around 1.75%.source:European Central Bank",

The growth was supported by stronger domestic demand, fueled by easing inflation and lower borrowing costs, and renewed optimism following Germany’s decision to relax fiscal constraints. Expectations of increased defense spending in the coming months also helped counterbalance ongoing concerns over volatile U.S. tariff policies. However, momentum may soften in the months ahead, as the impact of new U.S. trade duties begins to weigh on EU exports, while rising uncertainty curbs business investment and household consumption. Among major economies, Germany expanded by 0.2%, while Spain and Italy outperformed with growth rates of 0.6% and 0.3%, respectively.

Dr. Cyrus de la Rubia, Chief Economist at Hamburg Commercial Bank, noted that while foreign demand for services softened, it was sluggish domestic demand that appeared to weigh more heavily on the sector. In terms of prices, input costs inflation accelerated slightly compared to April. On a positive note, there was a modest increase in staffing levels.

This marked the smallest increase since Q4 2021, supporting the European Central Bank’s view that wage-driven inflation pressures are easing. The slowdown in pay growth bolsters the case for further interest rate cuts, with the ECB expected to reduce rates again next month. Services inflation, which is heavily influenced by wages, rose 4% in April, but overall inflation held steady at 2.2%. The European Commission expects inflation to fall to 2% by mid-2025 and dip below that in 2026. Recent wage agreements suggest workers are struggling to secure large pay hikes, with Germany’s public sector agreeing to a 5.8% raise spread over two years.

Speaking about the Fed’s ongoing review of its policy framework, last updated in 2020, Powell said the economy has changed a lot since then. He warned that inflation might become more volatile in the future due to more frequent supply shocks, which could make it harder for central banks to achieve price stability. Throughout his remarks, Powell also stressed the critical role of anchored inflation expectations, which have underpinned several of the longest US economic expansions. He reaffirmed the Fed’s strong commitment to its 2% inflation target, noting that without well-anchored expectations, the recent disinflation would likely have come at the cost of significant job losses.source:Federal Reserve",

Meanwhile, new orders declined at a slower pace (47.2 vs. 45.2), though new export orders fell more steeply amid ongoing tariff-related disruptions. Meanwhile, the rate of job losses moderated slightly (46.5 vs. 44.7).

Tokyo is currently negotiating a trade deal with Washington, which may influence future policy moves. The board signaled that it would raise rates if economic and price forecasts materialize. In its quarterly outlook, the BoJ lowered its FY 2025 GDP growth forecast to 0.5% from 1.0% projected in January, citing trade risks and policy uncertainty. The 2026 growth outlook was also reduced to 0.7% from 1.0%.

The decision reflects continued disinflation progress as external shocks eased and tight policy helped anchor inflation expectations. UK GDP growth has slowed since mid-2024, and the labour market is loosening. CPI inflation fell to 2.6% in March, though a temporary rise to 3.5% is expected in Q3 due to earlier energy price spikes. Inflation is forecast to ease again thereafter. Pay growth remains high but is expected to slow. Global uncertainty has risen due to new US tariffs, weakening global growth and lowering market interest rate expectations. The MPC remains committed to returning inflation to 2% sustainably. Future policy will depend on evolving risks and inflation dynamics. A cautious, data-driven approach to reducing policy restraint remains appropriate.source:Bank of England",

A modest downward contribution came from actual rents for housing, which rose by 6.3%, a slower pace compared to 7.2% in March.

Goods exports rose by 0.8%, driven by a 1.6% increase in shipments to the EU, largely due to higher fuel exports, particularly crude oil to the Netherlands. Non-EU exports were flat for a 2nd month, as higher car exports to the US were offset by lower shipments of non-ferrous metals to the US and crude oil to South Korea. Goods exports to the US increased for the fourth month. Meanwhile, goods imports fell 1.7%, mainly due to a 2.5% drop in non-EU imports from reduced aircraft, gas, and jewellery shipments. EU imports rose 0.9%, boosted by fuels from several countries and increases in chemicals and food, partially offset by fewer car imports from Germany. US goods imports decreased by £0.2 billion.

Since February, U.S. President Donald Trump has sharply raised tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%, prompting Beijing to retaliate with duties on American imports. China's policymakers have emphasized that the nation has ample tools to support its economic output, with Premier Li Qiang recently pledging further stimulus. Boosting consumption remains a top priority this year as the government seeks to offset the impact of surging U.S. duties. The Politburo is expected to meet later in April to outline upcoming policy plans.

New orders growth eased to a seven-month low amid a renewed decline in foreign sales, driven by higher US tariffs. Consequently, output growth also softened. Employment fell slightly due to signs of reduced capacity requirements, while backlogs of work declined for the first time since last September. Growth in purchasing activity weakened, and delivery times lengthened due to trade disruptions and supply-side constraints.

However, the latest figure marked a sharp slowdown from the 12.4% rise in March—the fastest growth since last October—as shipments to the US were dampened by Trump's tariffs and uncertainty surrounding trade talks between Washington and Beijing. Among trading partners, exports rose to Japan (7.8%), Taiwan (15.5%), Australia (5.8%), the EU (8.3%), and ASEAN (20.8%), while falling to the US (-21.0%) and South Korea (-0.3%). For the first four months of 2025, exports climbed 6.4% compared to the same period in 2024, reaching USD 1.17 trillion. During the period, shipments grew for agricultural products (5.0%), fertilizer (22.1%), textile (3.8%), and unwrought aluminum and aluminum products (0.5%). By contrast, exports dropped for rare earths (-15.3%) and clothing (-1.5%).

While marking the third straight monthly contraction in purchases, it was the mildest in the sequence, amid Beijing’s efforts to boost domestic demand and offset the impact of steep US tariffs. Imports from the US were down about 14%. The first trade talks between US and Chinese officials have been scheduled, raising hopes for a potential de-escalation of tensions. Meanwhile, Chinese policymakers are expected to maintain a mix of stimulus measures and targeted support to shore up consumption and stabilize imports in the coming months. Considering the first four months of the year, purchases slipped 5.2% to USD 800.3 billion.

While recent trade disputes and US tariffs are expected to weigh on economic growth, ECB officials still see a clear path to achieving price stability as disinflationary forces are likely to dominate in the short term. However, some policymakers cautioned that a prolonged trade war could cause long-term inflationary effects by disrupting global supply chains. At the April meeting, the ECB implemented its seventh rate cut in the past year and is widely expected to reduce rates again on June 5, with markets assigning a 90% probability to another cut. Investors also anticipate one further rate reduction later this year, after which the ECB’s deposit rate is projected to stabilize around 1.75%.source:European Central Bank",

The growth was supported by stronger domestic demand, fueled by easing inflation and lower borrowing costs, and renewed optimism following Germany’s decision to relax fiscal constraints. Expectations of increased defense spending in the coming months also helped counterbalance ongoing concerns over volatile U.S. tariff policies. However, momentum may soften in the months ahead, as the impact of new U.S. trade duties begins to weigh on EU exports, while rising uncertainty curbs business investment and household consumption. Among major economies, Germany expanded by 0.2%, while Spain and Italy outperformed with growth rates of 0.6% and 0.3%, respectively.

This marked the smallest increase since Q4 2021, supporting the European Central Bank’s view that wage-driven inflation pressures are easing. The slowdown in pay growth bolsters the case for further interest rate cuts, with the ECB expected to reduce rates again next month. Services inflation, which is heavily influenced by wages, rose 4% in April, but overall inflation held steady at 2.2%. The European Commission expects inflation to fall to 2% by mid-2025 and dip below that in 2026. Recent wage agreements suggest workers are struggling to secure large pay hikes, with Germany’s public sector agreeing to a 5.8% raise spread over two years.

Speaking about the Fed’s ongoing review of its policy framework, last updated in 2020, Powell said the economy has changed a lot since then. He warned that inflation might become more volatile in the future due to more frequent supply shocks, which could make it harder for central banks to achieve price stability. Throughout his remarks, Powell also stressed the critical role of anchored inflation expectations, which have underpinned several of the longest US economic expansions. He reaffirmed the Fed’s strong commitment to its 2% inflation target, noting that without well-anchored expectations, the recent disinflation would likely have come at the cost of significant job losses.source:Federal Reserve",

The reading signaled a second consecutive month of contraction in the manufacturing sector as output shrank more sharply (44.0 vs. 48.3) and prices rose further (69.8 vs. 69.4). Meanwhile, new orders declined at a slower pace (47.2 vs. 45.2), though new export orders fell more steeply amid ongoing tariff-related disruptions. Meanwhile, the rate of job losses moderated slightly (46.5 vs. 44.7). The ISM survey also revealed U.S. manufacturers were grappling with rising costs and margin pressure, while ongoing trade uncertainty was disrupting supply chains, causing shipping delays, complex duties, and frequent changes in cost structures. At the same time, they said customer demand was becoming more volatile, with some clients delaying orders or pushing tariff costs back onto manufacturers.source:Institute for Supply Management",

The unanimous decision came amid rising concerns that U.S. President Trump's tariff measures could dampen both U.S. and global economic growth. Tokyo is currently negotiating a trade deal with Washington, which may influence future policy moves. The board signaled that it would raise rates if economic and price forecasts materialize. In its quarterly outlook, the BoJ lowered its FY 2025 GDP growth forecast to 0.5% from 1.0% projected in January, citing trade risks and policy uncertainty. The 2026 growth outlook was also reduced to 0.7% from 1.0%. The BoJ also trimmed its core inflation forecast for FY 2025 to 2.2% from 2.7% and expects it to ease further to 1.7% in FY 2026 before ticking up to 1.9% in FY 2027.

The net trade subtracted 0.8ppts from the GDP, as exports fell for the first time since Q1 2024 (-0.6% vs 1.7% in Q4), while imports rebounded (2.9% vs -1.4%). At the same time, private consumption—accounting for over half of economic output— was flat, missing forecasts of a 0.1% rise. Government spending also stagnated after rising in the prior three quarters. Positively, business investment accelerated robustly (1.4% vs 0.8%), posting its strongest gain since Q2 2024. On an annualized basis, the economy contracted 0.7%, worse than consensus of a 0.2% drop and a reversal from an upwardly revised 2.4% gain in Q4. It marked the first yearly fall in a year.source:Cabinet Office, Japan",

The decision reflects continued disinflation progress as external shocks eased and tight policy helped anchor inflation expectations. UK GDP growth has slowed since mid-2024, and the labour market is loosening. CPI inflation fell to 2.6% in March, though a temporary rise to 3.5% is expected in Q3 due to earlier energy price spikes. Inflation is forecast to ease again thereafter. Pay growth remains high but is expected to slow. Global uncertainty has risen due to new US tariffs, weakening global growth and lowering market interest rate expectations. The MPC remains committed to returning inflation to 2% sustainably. Future policy will depend on evolving risks and inflation dynamics. A cautious, data-driven approach to reducing policy restraint remains appropriate.source:Bank of England",

Employment fell at the fastest pace in five years, driven by weak demand, rising payroll costs, and limited capacity pressures. Meanwhile, supplier delivery times lengthened the most since February 2024, reflecting international shipping delays and worsening port performance.

This marks the sharpest monthly growth since January, driven by a 3.9% rebound in food store sales after declines in February and March. Supermarkets, specialist food stores such as butchers and bakers, and alcohol and tobacco outlets all saw gains, with some retailers attributing the rise to favorable weather. In contrast, non-food store sales volumes fell by 0.7%, led by declines in clothing stores and other non-food outlets such as sports and second-hand goods retailers. However, department stores and household goods retailers posted modest increases, also supported by improved weather conditions. Excluding fuel, retail sales rose 1.3% from a month earlier.. On an annual basis, sales advanced 5%, the steepest increase since February 2022, surpassing estimates of 4.5% and March’s 1.9% growth.source:Office for National Statistics",

Since February, U.S. President Donald Trump has sharply raised tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%, prompting Beijing to retaliate with duties on American imports. China's policymakers have emphasized that the nation has ample tools to support its economic output, with Premier Li Qiang recently pledging further stimulus. Boosting consumption remains a top priority this year as the government seeks to offset the impact of surging U.S. duties. The Politburo is expected to meet later in April to outline upcoming policy plans.

Within manufacturing, 36 out of 41 major sectors showed expansion, notably computer and communication (10.8%), heat production (1.2%), ferrous metal smelting and rolling processing (5.8%), non-ferrous metal smelting (7.5%), coal mining and washing (6.3%), cars (9.2%), textiles (2.9%), chemical products (8.0%), and oil and natural gas (4.3%). Monthly, industrial output climbed by 0.22% in April. In the first four months of 2025, industrial production expanded by 6.4%. Last year, industrial output rose by 5.8%.source:National Bureau of Statistics of China",

While recent trade disputes and US tariffs are expected to weigh on economic growth, ECB officials still see a clear path to achieving price stability as disinflationary forces are likely to dominate in the short term. However, some policymakers cautioned that a prolonged trade war could cause long-term inflationary effects by disrupting global supply chains. At the April meeting, the ECB implemented its seventh rate cut in the past year and is widely expected to reduce rates again on June 5, with markets assigning a 90% probability to another cut. Investors also anticipate one further rate reduction later this year, after which the ECB’s deposit rate is projected to stabilize around 1.75%.source:European Central Bank",

The growth was supported by stronger domestic demand, fueled by easing inflation and lower borrowing costs, and renewed optimism following Germany’s decision to relax fiscal constraints. Expectations of increased defense spending in the coming months also helped counterbalance ongoing concerns over volatile U.S. tariff policies. However, momentum may soften in the months ahead, as the impact of new U.S. trade duties begins to weigh on EU exports, while rising uncertainty curbs business investment and household consumption. Among major economies, Germany expanded by 0.2%, while Spain and Italy outperformed with growth rates of 0.6% and 0.3%, respectively. In contrast, France and the Netherlands posted more modest gains, each growing by just 0.1%.source:EUROSTAT",

This marked the smallest increase since Q4 2021, supporting the European Central Bank’s view that wage-driven inflation pressures are easing. The slowdown in pay growth bolsters the case for further interest rate cuts, with the ECB expected to reduce rates again next month. Services inflation, which is heavily influenced by wages, rose 4% in April, but overall inflation held steady at 2.2%. The European Commission expects inflation to fall to 2% by mid-2025 and dip below that in 2026. Recent wage agreements suggest workers are struggling to secure large pay hikes, with Germany’s public sector agreeing to a 5.8% raise spread over two years.

Speaking about the Fed’s ongoing review of its policy framework, last updated in 2020, Powell said the economy has changed a lot since then. He warned that inflation might become more volatile in the future due to more frequent supply shocks, which could make it harder for central banks to achieve price stability. Throughout his remarks, Powell also stressed the critical role of anchored inflation expectations, which have underpinned several of the longest US economic expansions. He reaffirmed the Fed’s strong commitment to its 2% inflation target, noting that without well-anchored expectations, the recent disinflation would likely have come at the cost of significant job losses.source:Federal Reserve",

Meanwhile, new orders declined at a slower pace (47.2 vs. 45.2), though new export orders fell more steeply amid ongoing tariff-related disruptions. Meanwhile, the rate of job losses moderated slightly (46.5 vs. 44.7).

Tokyo is currently negotiating a trade deal with Washington, which may influence future policy moves. The board signaled that it would raise rates if economic and price forecasts materialize. In its quarterly outlook, the BoJ lowered its FY 2025 GDP growth forecast to 0.5% from 1.0% projected in January, citing trade risks and policy uncertainty. The 2026 growth outlook was also reduced to 0.7% from 1.0%.

The decision reflects continued disinflation progress as external shocks eased and tight policy helped anchor inflation expectations. UK GDP growth has slowed since mid-2024, and the labour market is loosening. CPI inflation fell to 2.6% in March, though a temporary rise to 3.5% is expected in Q3 due to earlier energy price spikes. Inflation is forecast to ease again thereafter. Pay growth remains high but is expected to slow. Global uncertainty has risen due to new US tariffs, weakening global growth and lowering market interest rate expectations. The MPC remains committed to returning inflation to 2% sustainably. Future policy will depend on evolving risks and inflation dynamics. A cautious, data-driven approach to reducing policy restraint remains appropriate.source:Bank of England",

Goods exports rose by 0.8%, driven by a 1.6% increase in shipments to the EU, largely due to higher fuel exports, particularly crude oil to the Netherlands. Non-EU exports were flat for a 2nd month, as higher car exports to the US were offset by lower shipments of non-ferrous metals to the US and crude oil to South Korea. Goods exports to the US increased for the fourth month. Meanwhile, goods imports fell 1.7%, mainly due to a 2.5% drop in non-EU imports from reduced aircraft, gas, and jewellery shipments. EU imports rose 0.9%, boosted by fuels from several countries and increases in chemicals and food, partially offset by fewer car imports from Germany. US goods imports decreased by £0.2 billion.

New orders growth eased to a seven-month low amid a renewed decline in foreign sales, driven by higher US tariffs. Consequently, output growth also softened. Employment fell slightly due to signs of reduced capacity requirements, while backlogs of work declined for the first time since last September. Growth in purchasing activity weakened, and delivery times lengthened due to trade disruptions and supply-side constraints. On the price front, input costs fell amid subdued demand, leading to a fifth consecutive monthly drop in output prices.

The sharp increase was largely driven by an 8.1% year-on-year rise in exports, well above market forecasts of a 1.9% gain, despite easing from a 12.4% surge in March, as shipments to the US were dampened by Trump's tariffs. Meanwhile, imports fell by 0.2%, softer than market expectations of a 5.9% decline, following a 4.3% drop in March. The trade surplus with the US narrowed to USD 20.46 billion in April from USD 27.58 billion in March as exports plunged 21% yoy while imports fell 13.8%. For the first four months of the year, the country posted a USD 368.8 billion surplus. During the period, the trade surplus with the US reached USD 97.07 billion, with exports and imports shrinking 2.5% and 4.7%, respectively.source:General Administration of Customs",

While recent trade disputes and US tariffs are expected to weigh on economic growth, ECB officials still see a clear path to achieving price stability as disinflationary forces are likely to dominate in the short term. However, some policymakers cautioned that a prolonged trade war could cause long-term inflationary effects by disrupting global supply chains. At the April meeting, the ECB implemented its seventh rate cut in the past year and is widely expected to reduce rates again on June 5, with markets assigning a 90% probability to another cut. Investors also anticipate one further rate reduction later this year, after which the ECB’s deposit rate is projected to stabilize around 1.75%.source:European Central Bank",

The growth was supported by stronger domestic demand, fueled by easing inflation and lower borrowing costs, and renewed optimism following Germany’s decision to relax fiscal constraints. Expectations of increased defense spending in the coming months also helped counterbalance ongoing concerns over volatile U.S. tariff policies. However, momentum may soften in the months ahead, as the impact of new U.S. trade duties begins to weigh on EU exports, while rising uncertainty curbs business investment and household consumption. Among major economies, Germany expanded by 0.2%, while Spain and Italy outperformed with growth rates of 0.6% and 0.3%, respectively.

This marked the smallest increase since Q4 2021, supporting the European Central Bank’s view that wage-driven inflation pressures are easing. The slowdown in pay growth bolsters the case for further interest rate cuts, with the ECB expected to reduce rates again next month. Services inflation, which is heavily influenced by wages, rose 4% in April, but overall inflation held steady at 2.2%. The European Commission expects inflation to fall to 2% by mid-2025 and dip below that in 2026. Recent wage agreements suggest workers are struggling to secure large pay hikes, with Germany’s public sector agreeing to a 5.8% raise spread over two years.

Policymakers viewed this uncertainty as unusually high and judged that downside risks to employment and economic activity, as well as upside risks to inflation, had increased. In discussing the outlook for monetary policy, participants agreed that, with economic growth and the labor market remaining solid and current policy stance moderately restrictive, the Fed was well positioned to remain patient and await greater clarity on inflation and economic trends. The Federal Reserve kept the funds rate at 4.25%–4.50% for a third consecutive meeting in May 2025, in line with expectations.source:Federal Reserve",

A 41.3% surge in imports contributed to the slowdown, as businesses and consumers rushed to stockpile goods in anticipation of higher costs following a series of tariff announcements by the Trump administration. Consumer spending growth also cooled to 1.8%, the slowest pace since Q2 2023, while federal government expenditures fell 5.1%, the steepest drop since Q1 2022. In contrast, fixed investment surged 7.8%, the most since Q2 2023.source:U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis",

Meanwhile, the rate of job losses moderated slightly (46.5 vs. 44.7).

Tokyo is currently negotiating a trade deal with Washington, which may influence future policy moves. The board signaled that it would raise rates if economic and price forecasts materialize. In its quarterly outlook, the BoJ lowered its FY 2025 GDP growth forecast to 0.5% from 1.0% projected in January, citing trade risks and policy uncertainty. The 2026 growth outlook was also reduced to 0.7% from 1.0%. The BoJ also trimmed its core inflation forecast for FY 2025 to 2.2% from 2.7% and expects it to ease further to 1.7% in FY 2026 before ticking up to 1.9% in FY 2027.

The decision reflects continued disinflation progress as external shocks eased and tight policy helped anchor inflation expectations. UK GDP growth has slowed since mid-2024, and the labour market is loosening. CPI inflation fell to 2.6% in March, though a temporary rise to 3.5% is expected in Q3 due to earlier energy price spikes. Inflation is forecast to ease again thereafter. Pay growth remains high but is expected to slow. Global uncertainty has risen due to new US tariffs, weakening global growth and lowering market interest rate expectations. The MPC remains committed to returning inflation to 2% sustainably. Future policy will depend on evolving risks and inflation dynamics. A cautious, data-driven approach to reducing policy restraint remains appropriate.source:Bank of England",

In contrast, construction output remained unchanged. Looking at the expenditure side, growth was supported by a 2.9% increase in gross fixed capital formation, mainly due to higher imports of aircraft, along with investments in ICT equipment, other machinery and equipment, and construction of buildings and structures.

The reading signaled a sharp deterioration in the manufacturing sector, as output contracted more quickly and new orders continued to decline amid rising global economic uncertainty. Employment fell at the fastest pace in five years, driven by weak demand, rising payroll costs, and limited capacity pressures. Meanwhile, supplier delivery times lengthened the most since February 2024, reflecting international shipping delays and worsening port performance. On the cost side, input prices continued to rise sharply, though the pace of increase eased.

Since February, U.S. President Donald Trump has sharply raised tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%, prompting Beijing to retaliate with duties on American imports. China's policymakers have emphasized that the nation has ample tools to support its economic output, with Premier Li Qiang recently pledging further stimulus. Boosting consumption remains a top priority this year as the government seeks to offset the impact of surging U.S. duties. The Politburo is expected to meet later in April to outline upcoming policy plans.

Employment fell slightly due to signs of reduced capacity requirements, while backlogs of work declined for the first time since last September.

While recent trade disputes and US tariffs are expected to weigh on economic growth, ECB officials still see a clear path to achieving price stability as disinflationary forces are likely to dominate in the short term. However, some policymakers cautioned that a prolonged trade war could cause long-term inflationary effects by disrupting global supply chains. At the April meeting, the ECB implemented its seventh rate cut in the past year and is widely expected to reduce rates again on June 5, with markets assigning a 90% probability to another cut. Investors also anticipate one further rate reduction later this year, after which the ECB’s deposit rate is projected to stabilize around 1.75%.source:European Central Bank",

The growth was supported by stronger domestic demand, fueled by easing inflation and lower borrowing costs, and renewed optimism following Germany’s decision to relax fiscal constraints. Expectations of increased defense spending in the coming months also helped counterbalance ongoing concerns over volatile U.S. tariff policies. However, momentum may soften in the months ahead, as the impact of new U.S. trade duties begins to weigh on EU exports, while rising uncertainty curbs business investment and household consumption. Among major economies, Germany expanded by 0.2%, while Spain and Italy outperformed with growth rates of 0.6% and 0.3%, respectively. In contrast, France and the Netherlands posted more modest gains, each growing by just 0.1%.source:EUROSTAT",

This marked the smallest increase since Q4 2021, supporting the European Central Bank’s view that wage-driven inflation pressures are easing. The slowdown in pay growth bolsters the case for further interest rate cuts, with the ECB expected to reduce rates again next month. Services inflation, which is heavily influenced by wages, rose 4% in April, but overall inflation held steady at 2.2%. The European Commission expects inflation to fall to 2% by mid-2025 and dip below that in 2026. Recent wage agreements suggest workers are struggling to secure large pay hikes, with Germany’s public sector agreeing to a 5.8% raise spread over two years.

The reading signaled a second consecutive month of contraction in the manufacturing sector as output shrank more sharply (44.0 vs. 48.3) and prices rose further (69.8 vs. 69.4). Meanwhile, new orders declined at a slower pace (47.2 vs. 45.2), though new export orders fell more steeply amid ongoing tariff-related disruptions. Meanwhile, the rate of job losses moderated slightly (46.5 vs. 44.7). The ISM survey also revealed U.S. manufacturers were grappling with rising costs and margin pressure, while ongoing trade uncertainty was disrupting supply chains, causing shipping delays, complex duties, and frequent changes in cost structures. At the same time, they said customer demand was becoming more volatile, with some clients delaying orders or pushing tariff costs back onto manufacturers.source:Institute for Supply Management",

The unanimous decision came amid rising concerns that U.S. President Trump's tariff measures could dampen both U.S. and global economic growth. Tokyo is currently negotiating a trade deal with Washington, which may influence future policy moves. The board signaled that it would raise rates if economic and price forecasts materialize. In its quarterly outlook, the BoJ lowered its FY 2025 GDP growth forecast to 0.5% from 1.0% projected in January, citing trade risks and policy uncertainty. The 2026 growth outlook was also reduced to 0.7% from 1.0%. The BoJ also trimmed its core inflation forecast for FY 2025 to 2.2% from 2.7% and expects it to ease further to 1.7% in FY 2026 before ticking up to 1.9% in FY 2027.

The latest result signaled a second consecutive expansion in services activity, though the pace of growth slowed amid weakening client demand and uncertainty over the future trade environment due to rising U.S. tariffs. New orders rose at the slowest pace in 11 months, while foreign sales saw only a marginal increase. Meanwhile, employment growth eased to a 17-month low, and backlogs of work accumulated at the slowest rate in three months. On the inflation front, both input costs and selling prices rose at slightly softer—yet still historically elevated—rates. Lastly, business confidence for the 12-month outlook declined to its lowest level since January 2021, reflecting growing concerns about future demand.source: S&P Global",

UK GDP growth has slowed since mid-2024, and the labour market is loosening. CPI inflation fell to 2.6% in March, though a temporary rise to 3.5% is expected in Q3 due to earlier energy price spikes. Inflation is forecast to ease again thereafter. Pay growth remains high but is expected to slow. Global uncertainty has risen due to new US tariffs, weakening global growth and lowering market interest rate expectations. The MPC remains committed to returning inflation to 2% sustainably.

Goods exports rose by 0.8%, driven by a 1.6% increase in shipments to the EU, largely due to higher fuel exports, particularly crude oil to the Netherlands. Non-EU exports were flat for a 2nd month, as higher car exports to the US were offset by lower shipments of non-ferrous metals to the US and crude oil to South Korea. Goods exports to the US increased for the fourth month. Meanwhile, goods imports fell 1.7%, mainly due to a 2.5% drop in non-EU imports from reduced aircraft, gas, and jewellery shipments. EU imports rose 0.9%, boosted by fuels from several countries and increases in chemicals and food, partially offset by fewer car imports from Germany. US goods imports decreased by £0.2 billion.

It marked the softest quarterly expansion since Q2 of 2024 while representing the 11th consecutive quarter of advance. Since February, U.S. President Donald Trump has sharply raised tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%, prompting Beijing to retaliate with duties on American imports. China's policymakers have emphasized that the nation has ample tools to support its economic output, with Premier Li Qiang recently pledging further stimulus. Boosting consumption remains a top priority this year as the government seeks to offset the impact of surging U.S. duties. The Politburo is expected to meet later in April to outline upcoming policy plans. In March, China announced increased fiscal spending, including a higher budget deficit, and officials have signaled more fiscal and monetary support ahead, following a wave of easing measures late last year.source:National Bureau of Statistics of China",

The sharp increase was largely driven by an 8.1% year-on-year rise in exports, well above market forecasts of a 1.9% gain, despite easing from a 12.4% surge in March, as shipments to the US were dampened by Trump's tariffs. Meanwhile, imports fell by 0.2%, softer than market expectations of a 5.9% decline, following a 4.3% drop in March. The trade surplus with the US narrowed to USD 20.46 billion in April from USD 27.58 billion in March as exports plunged 21% yoy while imports fell 13.8%. For the first four months of the year, the country posted a USD 368.8 billion surplus.
