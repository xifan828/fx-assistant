The absence of immediate economic events suggests that technical factors might dominate short-term movements.Given the strong technical bearish signals and the absence of immediate economic events, a short position is advised. The entry point is set at 1.0350, which is a key support level. A break below this level with strong momentum would confirm the downtrend continuation. The take profit is set at 1.0320, slightly above the S1 pivot point, to capture potential profits before hitting strong support. The stop loss is set at 1.0375, above the immediate resistance and pivot point, to protect against unexpected reversals.

The lack of events today means that current price movements are likely driven by technical factors and existing market sentiment rather than new economic data.Given the strong bearish sentiment from recent news and the longer-term bearish outlook, combined with the short-term bullish reversal in the technical analysis, the strategy is to wait for further confirmation. The R2 pivot point at 1.03613 is a critical level. If the price breaks above with strong bullish momentum, it could indicate a continuation of the short-term bullish trend.

Immediate resistance is around 1.0275-1.0280, and immediate support is around 1.0260. The recent break below 1.0280 suggests further downside potential.

Upcoming economic events, such as Germany's Unemployment Change and the US ISM Manufacturing PMI, could impact the EUR/USD pair. However, there is a time gap before these events, allowing for short-term trades based on current technical conditions.The strong downtrend on the 15-minute chart, confirmed by the hourly analysis, and the bearish sentiment from recent news due to a strong U.S. dollar, support a short position in the EUR/USD. The technical indicators suggest entering short on pullbacks to the 1.0273-1.0280 resistance zone with a stop-loss above this level. Given the current bearish momentum, the price is likely to continue lower, targeting the next psychological level around 1.0250. The confidence score is high due to the confluence of technical and fundamental factors supporting a bearish outlook.",sell,1.0275,1.025,1.0285,4,pending,openai,,,,,,,,,2025-01-02 19:01:41+01:00
