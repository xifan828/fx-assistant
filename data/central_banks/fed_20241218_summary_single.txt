## Federal Open Market Committee US

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) has announced that economic activity continues to expand at a solid pace, although labor market conditions have eased slightly, leading to a modest increase in the unemployment rate, which remains low. Inflation is progressing towards the Committee's 2 percent target but is still somewhat elevated.

To support its goals of maximum employment and stable inflation, the FOMC has decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 25 basis points to a range of 4.25% to 4.50%. The Committee will carefully evaluate incoming data and the evolving economic outlook when considering further adjustments to the rate. Additionally, the FOMC will continue to reduce its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt.

The Committee emphasizes its commitment to monitoring a wide range of economic indicators, including labor market conditions, inflation pressures, and international developments, to inform its monetary policy stance. The voting members supported this decision, with one dissenting vote preferring to maintain the previous rate range.

Overall, the FOMC remains attentive to the risks associated with achieving its dual mandate of employment and inflation stability.
