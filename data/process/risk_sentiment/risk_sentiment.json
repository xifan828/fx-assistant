            "risk_sentiment_analysis": "Global equity indices show a predominantly risk-on environment with strong gains in the S&P 500 (+0.70%), Nasdaq (+1.58%), and STOXX50 (+0.43%), although MSCI Emerging Markets dipped slightly (-0.38%). Commodity prices support this risk-on tone, with Brent Oil up 2.49% and Gold rising 0.81%, reflecting moderate risk appetite and safe-haven demand. Bond yields have increased modestly, with German and US 10-year yields up by 1.25% and 0.31% respectively, while yield spreads between US and Germany remain narrow (~2 bps), indicating limited divergence in monetary policy expectations but a cautious Fed stance. Overall, the market sentiment is cautiously optimistic, leaning towards risk-on due to softer US inflation and easing US-China trade tensions.",
            "key_market_drivers": "The primary market drivers include softer-than-expected US inflation data reducing the urgency for aggressive Fed hikes, the 90-day US-China tariff truce alleviating trade war fears and boosting risk sentiment, and the cautious Fed outlook delaying rate cuts. Equity gains and commodity price increases reflect improved risk appetite, while bond yields and tight yield spreads signal tempered expectations for monetary policy divergence. EUR/USD gains are supported by these factors alongside technical resistance near 1.12, with tariff-related inflation risks and mixed economic growth forecasts adding complexity.",
            "implications_for_trading": "The risk-on environment and narrowing US-Germany yield spreads support a modestly bullish EUR/USD outlook, as reduced Fed tightening pressure weakens the USD. The EUR/USD approaching key resistance near 1.1193-1.1213 suggests potential for further upside if broken, while support levels at 1.1145 and 1.1040 provide downside protection. Traders should watch US inflation data, Fed communications, and US-China trade developments closely, as shifts here could rapidly alter risk sentiment and yield expectations, impacting EUR/USD and other major pairs like USD/JPY. The cautious Fed stance and tariff truce reduce volatility risks but warrant vigilance for tariff-related inflation surprises.",
            "conclusion": "The market exhibits a cautiously optimistic, slightly risk-on tone driven by softer US inflation and eased trade tensions, supporting moderate EUR/USD gains near key technical resistance. EUR/USD traders should consider a bullish bias while remaining alert to tariff risks and Fed signals that could disrupt this environment.",

However, MSCI Emerging Markets declined slightly by 0.38%, suggesting some regional caution. Commodity prices are supportive of risk appetite, with Brent Oil up 2.49%, reflecting economic optimism, while Gold rose 0.81%, which may indicate some residual safe-haven demand or inflation concerns. The VIX decreased by 0.98%, signaling reduced market volatility and further supporting a risk-on sentiment. US Treasury yields edged higher modestly, with the 2-year yield up 0.10% and the 10-year yield up 0.31%, while Japanese yields declined, slightly narrowing the US-Japan yield spreads to around 3 basis points, reflecting a modestly less attractive US yield advantage. Overall, the market shows a cautiously risk-on stance driven by improved trade relations and softer US inflation data.",
            "key_market_drivers": "The primary market drivers include the softer-than-expected US CPI inflation data which has eased immediate Fed rate cut expectations, supporting equities and reducing safe-haven demand for USD and JPY. The 90-day US-China tariff truce has boosted risk sentiment, lifting global equities and commodity prices, particularly Brent Oil. Treasury yields and yield spreads are also influential, with US yields rising slightly while Japanese yields fall, maintaining a small positive interest rate differential favoring USD but with diminished magnitude. The DXY index's decline (-0.81%) reflects USD weakness amid these dynamics, and the USD/JPY pair's decline (-0.67%) is shaped by both risk sentiment and yield spread compression. Technical resistance near 148.7-149.0 and support around 147.1-147.3 are key levels influencing USD/JPY price action.",
            "implications_for_trading": "The improved risk sentiment and reduced safe-haven demand are bearish for JPY, which typically weakens in risk-on environments; however, the softer US inflation data and delayed Fed easing expectations limit USD strength. The narrow US-Japan yield spreads (around 3 bps) reduce the carry advantage of USD over JPY, contributing to USD/JPY downside pressure. Technical resistance near 148.7-149.0 caps upside, while support near 147.1-147.3 is critical to watch for potential bearish momentum if broken. Traders should be cautious of subdued USD/JPY volatility and consider that medium-term forecasts anticipate USD moderation or JPY resilience, suggesting potential trading opportunities on downside breaks or range-bound strategies near key technical levels. Monitoring US inflation data, Fed communications, and trade developments will be essential for directional cues.",
            "conclusion": "The market exhibits a cautiously risk-on tone supported by improved trade relations and softer US inflation, which weakens USD and USD/JPY near term despite modest US yield advantages. USD/JPY traders should watch key technical levels and remain alert to Fed policy signals and trade developments, as the pair faces constrained upside and potential downside risks amid a nuanced macroeconomic backdrop.",

            "key_market_drivers": "The primary market drivers include the US-China tariff truce which has significantly improved risk appetite and boosted the Chinese yuan, softer US inflation data that has moderated Fed rate cut expectations, and geopolitical easing such as the India-Pakistan ceasefire and potential Ukraine-Russia talks. Equities gains and rising Brent Oil prices underscore improved growth prospects, while the modest rise in US yields supports a less dovish Fed stance. The PBOC's intervention to manage yuan appreciation is also a key factor, balancing currency strength with export competitiveness. These elements collectively shape the current environment where risk assets and the yuan benefit, while the US dollar faces mixed pressures.",
            "implications_for_trading": "The improved risk sentiment and narrow but positive US-China yield spreads suggest downward pressure on USD/CNH, consistent with the yuan's recent surge to a six-month high. However, PBOC interventions to moderate rapid yuan appreciation introduce a risk of volatility and limit sharp declines in USD/CNH. The delayed Fed rate cut expectations support the US dollar broadly but are tempered by softer inflation data and trade optimism, creating a nuanced backdrop for FX traders. For USD/CNH, this implies potential trading opportunities on dips, but with caution due to possible PBOC actions and geopolitical uncertainties. Traders should closely monitor upcoming US economic data and trade negotiations for directional cues, as these will influence Fed policy outlook and yuan dynamics.",
            "conclusion": "The market is exhibiting a cautiously optimistic risk-on tone driven by the US-China tariff truce and easing geopolitical tensions, with the yuan strengthening but managed by PBOC interventions. USD/CNH traders should anticipate continued downward pressure on the pair amid improved risk sentiment but remain vigilant for volatility stemming from policy interventions and evolving trade developments.",

This suggests a slightly risk-on environment. Gold prices have increased by 0.93%, which typically signals some risk aversion, but the modest rise in Brent Oil (+0.05%) and a declining VIX (-0.92%) support improved risk appetite. Bond yields in both the US and Germany have risen slightly, with US yields higher than German yields by a small spread (2.07 bps for 2Y and 1.79 bps for 10Y), indicating a mild preference for US assets and expectations of a cautious Fed stance. Overall, the market reflects cautious optimism with moderate risk-on sentiment driven by softer US inflation and easing trade tensions.",
            "key_market_drivers": "The primary market drivers are the softer-than-expected US inflation data reducing the urgency for aggressive Fed hikes, the 90-day US-China tariff truce easing trade tensions and boosting risk sentiment, and the cautious Fed outlook delaying rate cuts. Equity gains, especially in US tech-heavy Nasdaq, combined with stable commodity prices and modestly rising bond yields, are shaping the current environment. The narrow US-Germany yield spreads suggest limited divergence in monetary policy expectations, while the DXY decline (-0.79%) supports euro strength. Technical resistance near 1.12 in EUR/USD is also a key factor influencing market positioning.",
            "implications_for_trading": "The slightly risk-on sentiment and narrowing yield spreads support a modestly bullish outlook for EUR/USD, as reduced Fed tightening pressure and improved trade relations favor euro appreciation against the dollar. The small US-Germany yield advantage keeps the USD supported but not dominant, allowing EUR/USD to test resistance near 1.1193-1.1213. Traders should watch for a break above this resistance to confirm further upside potential, while support levels at 1.1145 and 1.1040 provide risk management points. USD/JPY and other major pairs may also reflect cautious Fed expectations and improved risk appetite, suggesting opportunities in pairs sensitive to US monetary policy and trade developments.",
            "conclusion": "The market tone is cautiously optimistic with a slightly risk-on bias driven by softer US inflation and eased trade tensions, supporting moderate EUR/USD gains. Traders should focus on key resistance and support levels while monitoring Fed communications and trade developments for potential shifts in momentum or risk sentiment.",

The MSCI Emerging Markets index is flat, suggesting some regional caution but overall stable sentiment. Gold prices have risen (+0.93%), which typically signals safe-haven demand, but this is likely influenced by inflation concerns rather than risk aversion. Brent Oil is nearly unchanged (+0.05%), reflecting stable commodity demand. The VIX has declined (-0.92%), reinforcing reduced market volatility and improved risk appetite. US Treasury yields have inched higher (2Y +0.05%, 10Y +0.27%), while Japanese yields have fallen (2Y -1.12%, 10Y -0.83%), widening the US-Japan yield spreads slightly. This yield divergence supports the USD over JPY from a carry perspective but is tempered by softer US inflation and cautious Fed outlook.",

These factors have boosted risk sentiment, lifting global equities and reducing safe-haven demand for USD and JPY. Treasury yields and yield spreads are also influential, with US yields rising modestly while Japanese yields decline, maintaining a positive carry for USD/JPY. However, the cautious Fed stance and delayed rate cut expectations moderate USD strength. Technical resistance near 148.7-149.0 in USD/JPY is also a key factor limiting upside momentum.",
            "implications_for_trading": "The improved risk-on sentiment reduces safe-haven demand for JPY, which typically would support USD/JPY gains. However, the softer US inflation data and delayed Fed easing expectations weigh on the USD, creating a nuanced environment. The modestly wider US-Japan yield spreads provide some carry advantage to USD/JPY, but technical resistance near 148.7-149.0 caps near-term upside. Support around 147.1-147.3 is critical; a break below could signal bearish momentum. Traders should be cautious of limited USD strength amid persistent tariff and inflation uncertainties, with potential for subdued volatility and range-bound trading in USD/JPY.",
