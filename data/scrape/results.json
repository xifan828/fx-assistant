The decision reflects growing confidence that inflation is on track to return sustainably to the 2% target. Both headline and core inflation have continued to ease, with services inflation also cooling. Wage growth is moderating, and firms are absorbing some of the cost pressure. However, risks to the Euro Area outlook remain, especially due to rising global trade tensions, which are hurting confidence and tightening financial conditions. The ECB acknowledged that growth prospects have weakened and emphasized a data-dependent approach going forward. It made no commitment to further cuts, underlining that future decisions will depend on economic data, inflation dynamics, and the strength of monetary transmission.source:European Central Bank",

The pickup was supported by stronger domestic demand, driven by easing inflation, lower borrowing costs, renewed optimism following Germany's agreement to loosen fiscal constraints, and expectations of increased defense spending in the coming months. These developments helped offset persistent concerns over volatile U.S. tariff policies. However, economic momentum may soften in the months ahead, as the implementation of new U.S. duties begins to weigh on EU exports, while heightened uncertainty dampens investment and household consumption. Among major economies, Germany expanded by 0.2%, while Spain and Italy outperformed with growth rates of 0.6% and 0.3%, respectively. In contrast, France and the Netherlands recorded more modest growth, both at just 0.1%.source:EUROSTAT",

Meanwhile, new orders declined at a slower pace (47.2 vs. 45.2), though new export orders fell more steeply amid ongoing tariff-related disruptions. Meanwhile, the rate of job losses moderated slightly (46.5 vs. 44.7). The ISM survey also revealed U.S. manufacturers were grappling with rising costs and margin pressure, while ongoing trade uncertainty was disrupting supply chains, causing shipping delays, complex duties, and frequent changes in cost structures. At the same time, they said customer demand was becoming more volatile, with some clients delaying orders or pushing tariff costs back onto manufacturers.source:Institute for Supply Management",

Tokyo is currently negotiating a trade deal with Washington, which may influence future policy moves. The board signaled that it would raise rates if economic and price forecasts materialize. In its quarterly outlook, the BoJ lowered its FY 2025 GDP growth forecast to 0.5% from 1.0% projected in January, citing trade risks and policy uncertainty. The 2026 growth outlook was also reduced to 0.7% from 1.0%.

The data supports the Bank of Japan’s approach of gradual interest rate hikes, though rising economic risks, particularly from sweeping U.S. tariffs, cast a shadow over the outlook. The inflation figures arrive ahead of the BOJ’s policy meeting next week, where the central bank is expected to keep its benchmark rate unchanged at 0.5% and lower its growth forecasts. Core inflation has remained at or above the BOJ’s 2% target for nearly three years, driven by persistently high food prices and rising wages. While further rate hikes are anticipated later this year, the U.S. trade measures add uncertainty to Japan’s export-reliant economy.source:Statistics Bureau of Japan",

Although major Japanese firms agreed to average pay increases exceeding 5% during the annual spring wage negotiations, those hikes typically begin to appear in official data from April onward. The weaker-than-expected wage data adds to mounting concerns about Japan’s economic outlook, already clouded by tariff risks and monetary policy uncertainty. Attention now turns to next week’s first-quarter GDP report, with economists widely anticipating a contraction.source: Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare, Japan",

The decision reflects continued disinflation progress as external shocks eased and tight policy helped anchor inflation expectations. UK GDP growth has slowed since mid-2024, and the labour market is loosening. CPI inflation fell to 2.6% in March, though a temporary rise to 3.5% is expected in Q3 due to earlier energy price spikes. Inflation is forecast to ease again thereafter. Pay growth remains high but is expected to slow. Global uncertainty has risen due to new US tariffs, weakening global growth and lowering market interest rate expectations. The MPC remains committed to returning inflation to 2% sustainably. Future policy will depend on evolving risks and inflation dynamics. A cautious, data-driven approach to reducing policy restraint remains appropriate.source:Bank of England",

The largest downward contributions came from recreation and culture (2.4% vs 3.4%), mainly games, toys and hobbies (-4.2%) and data processing equipment (-5.1%). Transport also contributed to the slowdown (1.2% vs 1.8%), largely due to a 5.3% fall in motor fuel prices. In addition, prices rose less for restaurants and hotels (3%, the lowest since July 2021 vs 3.4%), mostly accommodation services (-0.6%); housing and utilities (1.8% vs 1.9%); and food and non-alcoholic beverages (3% vs 3.3%). In contrast, the most significant upward contribution came from clothing and footwear (1.1% vs -0.6%), with prices usually rising in March as spring fashions continue to enter the shops.

Also, household consumption increased 0.1%, revised up from the initial estimate of no growth, mostly due to spending on restaurants and hotels, and housing.

China's policymakers have emphasized that the nation has ample tools to support its economic output, with Premier Li Qiang recently pledging further stimulus. Boosting consumption remains a top priority this year as the government seeks to offset the impact of surging U.S. duties.

Both output (49.8 vs 52.6 in March) and new orders (49.2 vs 51.8) declined after rising in the previous month, with foreign orders shrinking the most in at least eleven months (44.7 vs 49.0). Meanwhile, employment decreased at a faster pace (47.9 vs 48.2). Buying activity fell for the first time in three months (46.3 vs 51.8) while delivery times lengthened, the least since November 2024 (50.2 vs 50.3). On prices, input costs (47.0 vs 49.8) and selling prices (44.8 vs 47.9) both dropped the most in seven months. Lastly, confidence weakened to a seven-month low (52.1 vs 53.8).source:National Bureau of Statistics of China",

However, the latest figure marked a sharp slowdown from the 12.4% rise in March—the fastest growth since last October—as shipments to the US were dampened by Trump's tariffs and uncertainty surrounding trade talks between Washington and Beijing. Among trading partners, exports rose to Japan (7.8%), Taiwan (15.5%), Australia (5.8%), the EU (8.3%), and ASEAN (20.8%), while falling to the US (-21.0%) and South Korea (-0.3%). For the first four months of 2025, exports climbed 6.4% compared to the same period in 2024, reaching USD 1.17 trillion. During the period, shipments grew for agricultural products (5.0%), fertilizer (22.1%), textile (3.8%), and unwrought aluminum and aluminum products (0.5%). By contrast, exports dropped for rare earths (-15.3%) and clothing (-1.5%).

While marking the third straight monthly contraction in purchases, it was the mildest in the sequence, amid Beijing’s efforts to boost domestic demand and offset the impact of steep US tariffs. Imports from the US were down about 14%. The first trade talks between US and Chinese officials have been scheduled, raising hopes for a potential de-escalation of tensions. Meanwhile, Chinese policymakers are expected to maintain a mix of stimulus measures and targeted support to shore up consumption and stabilize imports in the coming months. Considering the first four months of the year, purchases slipped 5.2% to USD 800.3 billion. During the period, imports fell from the US (-4.7%) and the EU (-9.2%) but rose from the ASEAN countries (2.9%).source:General Administration of Customs",

The decision reflects growing confidence that inflation is on track to return sustainably to the 2% target. Both headline and core inflation have continued to ease, with services inflation also cooling. Wage growth is moderating, and firms are absorbing some of the cost pressure. However, risks to the Euro Area outlook remain, especially due to rising global trade tensions, which are hurting confidence and tightening financial conditions. The ECB acknowledged that growth prospects have weakened and emphasized a data-dependent approach going forward. It made no commitment to further cuts, underlining that future decisions will depend on economic data, inflation dynamics, and the strength of monetary transmission.source:European Central Bank",

The pickup was supported by stronger domestic demand, driven by easing inflation, lower borrowing costs, renewed optimism following Germany's agreement to loosen fiscal constraints, and expectations of increased defense spending in the coming months. These developments helped offset persistent concerns over volatile U.S. tariff policies. However, economic momentum may soften in the months ahead, as the implementation of new U.S. duties begins to weigh on EU exports, while heightened uncertainty dampens investment and household consumption. Among major economies, Germany expanded by 0.2%, while Spain and Italy outperformed with growth rates of 0.6% and 0.3%, respectively. In contrast, France and the Netherlands recorded more modest growth, both at just 0.1%.source:EUROSTAT",

Policymakers noted that uncertainty about the economic outlook has increased further and that the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen.

Meanwhile, new orders declined at a slower pace (47.2 vs. 45.2), though new export orders fell more steeply amid ongoing tariff-related disruptions. Meanwhile, the rate of job losses moderated slightly (46.5 vs. 44.7). The ISM survey also revealed U.S. manufacturers were grappling with rising costs and margin pressure, while ongoing trade uncertainty was disrupting supply chains, causing shipping delays, complex duties, and frequent changes in cost structures. At the same time, they said customer demand was becoming more volatile, with some clients delaying orders or pushing tariff costs back onto manufacturers.source:Institute for Supply Management",

Tokyo is currently negotiating a trade deal with Washington, which may influence future policy moves. The board signaled that it would raise rates if economic and price forecasts materialize. In its quarterly outlook, the BoJ lowered its FY 2025 GDP growth forecast to 0.5% from 1.0% projected in January, citing trade risks and policy uncertainty. The 2026 growth outlook was also reduced to 0.7% from 1.0%.

The data supports the Bank of Japan’s approach of gradual interest rate hikes, though rising economic risks, particularly from sweeping U.S. tariffs, cast a shadow over the outlook. The inflation figures arrive ahead of the BOJ’s policy meeting next week, where the central bank is expected to keep its benchmark rate unchanged at 0.5% and lower its growth forecasts. Core inflation has remained at or above the BOJ’s 2% target for nearly three years, driven by persistently high food prices and rising wages. While further rate hikes are anticipated later this year, the U.S. trade measures add uncertainty to Japan’s export-reliant economy.source:Statistics Bureau of Japan",

The decision reflects continued disinflation progress as external shocks eased and tight policy helped anchor inflation expectations. UK GDP growth has slowed since mid-2024, and the labour market is loosening. CPI inflation fell to 2.6% in March, though a temporary rise to 3.5% is expected in Q3 due to earlier energy price spikes. Inflation is forecast to ease again thereafter. Pay growth remains high but is expected to slow. Global uncertainty has risen due to new US tariffs, weakening global growth and lowering market interest rate expectations. The MPC remains committed to returning inflation to 2% sustainably. Future policy will depend on evolving risks and inflation dynamics. A cautious, data-driven approach to reducing policy restraint remains appropriate.source:Bank of England",

The largest downward contributions came from recreation and culture (2.4% vs 3.4%), mainly games, toys and hobbies (-4.2%) and data processing equipment (-5.1%). Transport also contributed to the slowdown (1.2% vs 1.8%), largely due to a 5.3% fall in motor fuel prices. In addition, prices rose less for restaurants and hotels (3%, the lowest since July 2021 vs 3.4%), mostly accommodation services (-0.6%); housing and utilities (1.8% vs 1.9%); and food and non-alcoholic beverages (3% vs 3.3%). In contrast, the most significant upward contribution came from clothing and footwear (1.1% vs -0.6%), with prices usually rising in March as spring fashions continue to enter the shops.

It marked the softest quarterly expansion since Q2 of 2024 while representing the 11th consecutive quarter of advance. Since February, U.S. President Donald Trump has sharply raised tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%, prompting Beijing to retaliate with duties on American imports. China's policymakers have emphasized that the nation has ample tools to support its economic output, with Premier Li Qiang recently pledging further stimulus. Boosting consumption remains a top priority this year as the government seeks to offset the impact of surging U.S. duties. The Politburo is expected to meet later in April to outline upcoming policy plans.

Both output (49.8 vs 52.6 in March) and new orders (49.2 vs 51.8) declined after rising in the previous month, with foreign orders shrinking the most in at least eleven months (44.7 vs 49.0). Meanwhile, employment decreased at a faster pace (47.9 vs 48.2). Buying activity fell for the first time in three months (46.3 vs 51.8) while delivery times lengthened, the least since November 2024 (50.2 vs 50.3). On prices, input costs (47.0 vs 49.8) and selling prices (44.8 vs 47.9) both dropped the most in seven months.

However, the latest figure marked a sharp slowdown from the 12.4% rise in March—the fastest growth since last October—as shipments to the US were dampened by Trump's tariffs and uncertainty surrounding trade talks between Washington and Beijing. Among trading partners, exports rose to Japan (7.8%), Taiwan (15.5%), Australia (5.8%), the EU (8.3%), and ASEAN (20.8%), while falling to the US (-21.0%) and South Korea (-0.3%).

During the period, shipments grew for agricultural products (5.0%), fertilizer (22.1%), textile (3.8%), and unwrought aluminum and aluminum products (0.5%). By contrast, exports dropped for rare earths (-15.3%) and clothing (-1.5%).

While marking the third straight monthly contraction in purchases, it was the mildest in the sequence, amid Beijing’s efforts to boost domestic demand and offset the impact of steep US tariffs. Imports from the US were down about 14%. The first trade talks between US and Chinese officials have been scheduled, raising hopes for a potential de-escalation of tensions. Meanwhile, Chinese policymakers are expected to maintain a mix of stimulus measures and targeted support to shore up consumption and stabilize imports in the coming months. Considering the first four months of the year, purchases slipped 5.2% to USD 800.3 billion.

The decision reflects growing confidence that inflation is on track to return sustainably to the 2% target. Both headline and core inflation have continued to ease, with services inflation also cooling. Wage growth is moderating, and firms are absorbing some of the cost pressure. However, risks to the Euro Area outlook remain, especially due to rising global trade tensions, which are hurting confidence and tightening financial conditions. The ECB acknowledged that growth prospects have weakened and emphasized a data-dependent approach going forward. It made no commitment to further cuts, underlining that future decisions will depend on economic data, inflation dynamics, and the strength of monetary transmission.source:European Central Bank",

The pickup was supported by stronger domestic demand, driven by easing inflation, lower borrowing costs, renewed optimism following Germany's agreement to loosen fiscal constraints, and expectations of increased defense spending in the coming months. These developments helped offset persistent concerns over volatile U.S. tariff policies. However, economic momentum may soften in the months ahead, as the implementation of new U.S. duties begins to weigh on EU exports, while heightened uncertainty dampens investment and household consumption. Among major economies, Germany expanded by 0.2%, while Spain and Italy outperformed with growth rates of 0.6% and 0.3%, respectively.

New orders continued to contract amid a sharp decline in export orders, owed to the sharp appreciation of the euro in the period and weak macroeconomic conditions due to trade war concerns in the US and China. Still, backlog reductions and a near stabilization in demand drove factories to accelerate their output to a three-year high.

The reading signaled a second consecutive month of contraction in the manufacturing sector as output shrank more sharply (44.0 vs. 48.3) and prices rose further (69.8 vs. 69.4). Meanwhile, new orders declined at a slower pace (47.2 vs. 45.2), though new export orders fell more steeply amid ongoing tariff-related disruptions. Meanwhile, the rate of job losses moderated slightly (46.5 vs. 44.7). The ISM survey also revealed U.S. manufacturers were grappling with rising costs and margin pressure, while ongoing trade uncertainty was disrupting supply chains, causing shipping delays, complex duties, and frequent changes in cost structures. At the same time, they said customer demand was becoming more volatile, with some clients delaying orders or pushing tariff costs back onto manufacturers.source:Institute for Supply Management",

The unanimous decision came amid rising concerns that U.S. President Trump's tariff measures could dampen both U.S. and global economic growth. Tokyo is currently negotiating a trade deal with Washington, which may influence future policy moves. The board signaled that it would raise rates if economic and price forecasts materialize. In its quarterly outlook, the BoJ lowered its FY 2025 GDP growth forecast to 0.5% from 1.0% projected in January, citing trade risks and policy uncertainty. The 2026 growth outlook was also reduced to 0.7% from 1.0%. The BoJ also trimmed its core inflation forecast for FY 2025 to 2.2% from 2.7% and expects it to ease further to 1.7% in FY 2026 before ticking up to 1.9% in FY 2027.

Core inflation has remained at or above the BOJ’s 2% target for nearly three years, driven by persistently high food prices and rising wages.

This was the sixth consecutive month of expansion, with new orders rising at the fastest pace in nearly a year, while overseas demand continued to grow, albeit at a slower rate. Firms hired staff at the fastest pace since January, though backlogs rose only modestly. On the inflation front, input costs increased at the sharpest rate since February 2023. Meanwhile, output prices also rose solidly, as companies partially passed on higher expenses to clients to help ease pressure on margins. However, business optimism for the year ahead slipped to its lowest level since January 2021, amid concerns over the global economic and trade outlook, labor shortages, and inflation.source: S&P Global",

The decision reflects continued disinflation progress as external shocks eased and tight policy helped anchor inflation expectations. UK GDP growth has slowed since mid-2024, and the labour market is loosening. CPI inflation fell to 2.6% in March, though a temporary rise to 3.5% is expected in Q3 due to earlier energy price spikes. Inflation is forecast to ease again thereafter. Pay growth remains high but is expected to slow. Global uncertainty has risen due to new US tariffs, weakening global growth and lowering market interest rate expectations. The MPC remains committed to returning inflation to 2% sustainably.

It marked the softest quarterly expansion since Q2 of 2024 while representing the 11th consecutive quarter of advance. Since February, U.S. President Donald Trump has sharply raised tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%, prompting Beijing to retaliate with duties on American imports. China's policymakers have emphasized that the nation has ample tools to support its economic output, with Premier Li Qiang recently pledging further stimulus. Boosting consumption remains a top priority this year as the government seeks to offset the impact of surging U.S. duties. The Politburo is expected to meet later in April to outline upcoming policy plans. In March, China announced increased fiscal spending, including a higher budget deficit, and officials have signaled more fiscal and monetary support ahead, following a wave of easing measures late last year.source:National Bureau of Statistics of China",

New orders growth eased to a seven-month low amid a renewed decline in foreign sales, driven by higher US tariffs. Consequently, output growth also softened. Employment fell slightly due to signs of reduced capacity requirements, while backlogs of work declined for the first time since last September. Growth in purchasing activity weakened, and delivery times lengthened due to trade disruptions and supply-side constraints.

The sharp increase was largely driven by an 8.1% year-on-year rise in exports, well above market forecasts of a 1.9% gain, despite easing from a 12.4% surge in March, as shipments to the US were dampened by Trump's tariffs. Meanwhile, imports fell by 0.2%, softer than market expectations of a 5.9% decline, following a 4.3% drop in March. The trade surplus with the US narrowed to USD 20.46 billion in April from USD 27.58 billion in March as exports plunged 21% yoy while imports fell 13.8%. For the first four months of the year, the country posted a USD 368.8 billion surplus.

The decision reflects growing confidence that inflation is on track to return sustainably to the 2% target. Both headline and core inflation have continued to ease, with services inflation also cooling. Wage growth is moderating, and firms are absorbing some of the cost pressure. However, risks to the Euro Area outlook remain, especially due to rising global trade tensions, which are hurting confidence and tightening financial conditions. The ECB acknowledged that growth prospects have weakened and emphasized a data-dependent approach going forward. It made no commitment to further cuts, underlining that future decisions will depend on economic data, inflation dynamics, and the strength of monetary transmission.source:European Central Bank",

The pickup was supported by stronger domestic demand, driven by easing inflation, lower borrowing costs, renewed optimism following Germany's agreement to loosen fiscal constraints, and expectations of increased defense spending in the coming months. These developments helped offset persistent concerns over volatile U.S. tariff policies. However, economic momentum may soften in the months ahead, as the implementation of new U.S. duties begins to weigh on EU exports, while heightened uncertainty dampens investment and household consumption. Among major economies, Germany expanded by 0.2%, while Spain and Italy outperformed with growth rates of 0.6% and 0.3%, respectively.

New orders continued to contract amid a sharp decline in export orders, owed to the sharp appreciation of the euro in the period and weak macroeconomic conditions due to trade war concerns in the US and China. Still, backlog reductions and a near stabilization in demand drove factories to accelerate their output to a three-year high.

The reading signaled a second consecutive month of contraction in the manufacturing sector as output shrank more sharply (44.0 vs. 48.3) and prices rose further (69.8 vs. 69.4). Meanwhile, new orders declined at a slower pace (47.2 vs. 45.2), though new export orders fell more steeply amid ongoing tariff-related disruptions. Meanwhile, the rate of job losses moderated slightly (46.5 vs. 44.7). The ISM survey also revealed U.S. manufacturers were grappling with rising costs and margin pressure, while ongoing trade uncertainty was disrupting supply chains, causing shipping delays, complex duties, and frequent changes in cost structures. At the same time, they said customer demand was becoming more volatile, with some clients delaying orders or pushing tariff costs back onto manufacturers.source:Institute for Supply Management",

The unanimous decision came amid rising concerns that U.S. President Trump's tariff measures could dampen both U.S. and global economic growth. Tokyo is currently negotiating a trade deal with Washington, which may influence future policy moves. The board signaled that it would raise rates if economic and price forecasts materialize. In its quarterly outlook, the BoJ lowered its FY 2025 GDP growth forecast to 0.5% from 1.0% projected in January, citing trade risks and policy uncertainty. The 2026 growth outlook was also reduced to 0.7% from 1.0%. The BoJ also trimmed its core inflation forecast for FY 2025 to 2.2% from 2.7% and expects it to ease further to 1.7% in FY 2026 before ticking up to 1.9% in FY 2027.

Core inflation has remained at or above the BOJ’s 2% target for nearly three years, driven by persistently high food prices and rising wages.

This was the sixth consecutive month of expansion, with new orders rising at the fastest pace in nearly a year, while overseas demand continued to grow, albeit at a slower rate. Firms hired staff at the fastest pace since January, though backlogs rose only modestly. On the inflation front, input costs increased at the sharpest rate since February 2023. Meanwhile, output prices also rose solidly, as companies partially passed on higher expenses to clients to help ease pressure on margins. However, business optimism for the year ahead slipped to its lowest level since January 2021, amid concerns over the global economic and trade outlook, labor shortages, and inflation.source: S&P Global",

The decision reflects continued disinflation progress as external shocks eased and tight policy helped anchor inflation expectations. UK GDP growth has slowed since mid-2024, and the labour market is loosening. CPI inflation fell to 2.6% in March, though a temporary rise to 3.5% is expected in Q3 due to earlier energy price spikes. Inflation is forecast to ease again thereafter. Pay growth remains high but is expected to slow. Global uncertainty has risen due to new US tariffs, weakening global growth and lowering market interest rate expectations. The MPC remains committed to returning inflation to 2% sustainably.

It marked the softest quarterly expansion since Q2 of 2024 while representing the 11th consecutive quarter of advance. Since February, U.S. President Donald Trump has sharply raised tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%, prompting Beijing to retaliate with duties on American imports. China's policymakers have emphasized that the nation has ample tools to support its economic output, with Premier Li Qiang recently pledging further stimulus. Boosting consumption remains a top priority this year as the government seeks to offset the impact of surging U.S. duties. The Politburo is expected to meet later in April to outline upcoming policy plans. In March, China announced increased fiscal spending, including a higher budget deficit, and officials have signaled more fiscal and monetary support ahead, following a wave of easing measures late last year.source:National Bureau of Statistics of China",

New orders growth eased to a seven-month low amid a renewed decline in foreign sales, driven by higher US tariffs. Consequently, output growth also softened. Employment fell slightly due to signs of reduced capacity requirements, while backlogs of work declined for the first time since last September. Growth in purchasing activity weakened, and delivery times lengthened due to trade disruptions and supply-side constraints.

The decision reflects growing confidence that inflation is on track to return sustainably to the 2% target. Both headline and core inflation have continued to ease, with services inflation also cooling. Wage growth is moderating, and firms are absorbing some of the cost pressure. However, risks to the Euro Area outlook remain, especially due to rising global trade tensions, which are hurting confidence and tightening financial conditions. The ECB acknowledged that growth prospects have weakened and emphasized a data-dependent approach going forward. It made no commitment to further cuts, underlining that future decisions will depend on economic data, inflation dynamics, and the strength of monetary transmission.source:European Central Bank",

These developments helped offset persistent concerns over volatile U.S. tariff policies. However, economic momentum may soften in the months ahead, as the implementation of new U.S. duties begins to weigh on EU exports, while heightened uncertainty dampens investment and household consumption.

Still, backlog reductions and a near stabilization in demand drove factories to accelerate their output to a three-year high.

Policymakers noted that uncertainty about the economic outlook has increased further and that the risks of higher unemployment and higher inflation have risen. During the regular press conference, Fed Chair Powell said that it's too early to determine whether inflation or unemployment will emerge as the greater concern, and the Fed does not need to rush into adjusting interest rates. The central bank can afford to be patient, monitoring incoming data and adopting a wait-and-see approach. The Fed also said that that although swings in net exports have affected the data, recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace.source:Federal Reserve",

The reading signaled a second consecutive month of contraction in the manufacturing sector as output shrank more sharply (44.0 vs. 48.3) and prices rose further (69.8 vs. 69.4). Meanwhile, new orders declined at a slower pace (47.2 vs. 45.2), though new export orders fell more steeply amid ongoing tariff-related disruptions. Meanwhile, the rate of job losses moderated slightly (46.5 vs. 44.7). The ISM survey also revealed U.S. manufacturers were grappling with rising costs and margin pressure, while ongoing trade uncertainty was disrupting supply chains, causing shipping delays, complex duties, and frequent changes in cost structures. At the same time, they said customer demand was becoming more volatile, with some clients delaying orders or pushing tariff costs back onto manufacturers.source:Institute for Supply Management",

The unanimous decision came amid rising concerns that U.S. President Trump's tariff measures could dampen both U.S. and global economic growth. Tokyo is currently negotiating a trade deal with Washington, which may influence future policy moves. The board signaled that it would raise rates if economic and price forecasts materialize. In its quarterly outlook, the BoJ lowered its FY 2025 GDP growth forecast to 0.5% from 1.0% projected in January, citing trade risks and policy uncertainty. The 2026 growth outlook was also reduced to 0.7% from 1.0%. The BoJ also trimmed its core inflation forecast for FY 2025 to 2.2% from 2.7% and expects it to ease further to 1.7% in FY 2026 before ticking up to 1.9% in FY 2027.

The inflation figures arrive ahead of the BOJ’s policy meeting next week, where the central bank is expected to keep its benchmark rate unchanged at 0.5% and lower its growth forecasts. Core inflation has remained at or above the BOJ’s 2% target for nearly three years, driven by persistently high food prices and rising wages.

Output dropped again, though the pace of decline was the slowest in 2025. Buying activity fell for the seventh month, and inventories of inputs and finished goods were also lower. Employment edged up, but backlogs declined further due to a lack of new work. Supplier performance deteriorated, linked to material shortages. Input price inflation eased to a one-year low but stayed high due to rising transport, fuel, labor, and raw material costs.

The decision reflects continued disinflation progress as external shocks eased and tight policy helped anchor inflation expectations. UK GDP growth has slowed since mid-2024, and the labour market is loosening. CPI inflation fell to 2.6% in March, though a temporary rise to 3.5% is expected in Q3 due to earlier energy price spikes. Inflation is forecast to ease again thereafter. Pay growth remains high but is expected to slow. Global uncertainty has risen due to new US tariffs, weakening global growth and lowering market interest rate expectations. The MPC remains committed to returning inflation to 2% sustainably. Future policy will depend on evolving risks and inflation dynamics. A cautious, data-driven approach to reducing policy restraint remains appropriate.source:Bank of England",

Despite the upward revision, the index remained firmly in contraction territory, reflecting a sharp downturn in the sector. Output declined as manufacturers scaled back production in response to weakening demand from both domestic and international markets, amid mounting economic and trade uncertainty. Employment fell for the sixth consecutive month, with the pace of job losses marking the second-steepest in nearly five years. Meanwhile, backlogs of work were depleted at the fastest rate in 17 months. On the inflation front, input costs rose at their fastest pace since December 2022, while output price inflation accelerated to a 26-month high.

New business intake fell for the third time in four months, driven by a slowdown in business investment and lower client confidence due to US tariff announcements and the resulting market turmoil.

Employment has declined for seven consecutive months, with a slight acceleration in job cuts since March, amid rising payroll costs.

Since February, U.S. President Donald Trump has sharply raised tariffs on Chinese goods to 145%, prompting Beijing to retaliate with duties on American imports. China's policymakers have emphasized that the nation has ample tools to support its economic output, with Premier Li Qiang recently pledging further stimulus. Boosting consumption remains a top priority this year as the government seeks to offset the impact of surging U.S. duties. The Politburo is expected to meet later in April to outline upcoming policy plans.

Employment fell slightly due to signs of reduced capacity requirements, while backlogs of work declined for the first time since last September.
