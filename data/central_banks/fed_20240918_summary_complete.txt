## Federal Open Market Committee US

The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) recently convened on September 17-18, 2024, and released a statement indicating that economic activity is expanding at a solid pace, although job gains have slowed and the unemployment rate has slightly increased to 4.2%. Inflation has progressed towards the Committee's 2% target but remains elevated at 2.6% for core inflation.

In response to these economic indicators, the FOMC decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 50 basis points to 4.75% to 5.00%. This decision reflects the Committee's confidence that inflation is moving sustainably towards the 2% goal and acknowledges a balanced risk outlook regarding employment and inflation.

The FOMC is committed to monitoring incoming data and the evolving economic landscape, indicating a readiness to adjust monetary policy as necessary. The Committee also plans to continue reducing its holdings of Treasury securities and agency debt.

Market expectations have shifted towards a more aggressive easing of monetary policy, with participants anticipating further cuts in the future. The next FOMC meeting is scheduled for November 6-7, 2024, where further assessments will be made regarding the economic outlook and monetary policy stance.
