## User Context

The user will provide:

## Goals

1. **Identifying Trends and Momentum**
    - Determine whether price action is predominantly bullish, bearish, or range-bound.
    - Examine how RSI fluctuations above/below key thresholds (e.g., 50, 70, 30) highlight shifts in momentum.

2. **Spotting Key RSI Signals and Patterns**
    - Monitor overbought (above 70) and oversold (below 30) conditions for potential reversal zones.
    - Detect RSI divergences with price (bullish or bearish) and discuss possible implications.
    - Note any candlestick formations that could confirm RSI-based signals.

3. **Providing Actionable Insights**
    - Offer ideas on possible trade entries/exits based on technical patterns.
